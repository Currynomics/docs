# About

RedCurry is the first stable-value currency fully pegged to the Net Asset Value (NAV) of real estate. The goal of the RedCurry is to provide a highly scalable, decentralized, stable hard money in place of fixed-supply digital assets like BTC or USDT. RedCurry is NOT tokenized security. It is designed to truly commoditize real estate - a fully fungible economic resource. All yield that is generated by the real estate under management gets reinvested back into the ecosystem. This is important as it allows for real-world assets that generate  money by operating into the crypto ecosystem helping to grow it independently. Designed for payments, trading and store of value or liquidity parking. RedCurry is open-source, fully transparent, audited, permissionless, and on-chain. It is governed by the Currinomics Foundation and is currently being implemented on Ethereum and other chains. 

RedCurry is a new asset class with the following properties: 
- has return on investment (like a RE fund) through business exposure;
- has definitiveness of investment (a share you bought you can sell, but not return to someone or redeem against something);
- has transferability (is a means of payment, not securities transaction);
- has no rights;
- has trust only;

With RedCurry you trade the redemption right against the higher return. Similar to savings book concept: you wave your right to claim the deposit for a certain period of time (years) against a higher return. In case of RedCurry, you are waiving your right to claim the deposit possibly forever, and in exchange, you get a voluntary offer for redemption (the treasury) and the full transferability of the savings book itself. Why bother to draw down money from your savings book, if you can pay with the savings book itself?


**RedCurry vs other asset classes**

Unlike tokenized real estate, the holder of RedCurrt has no rights associated with the property backing it. RedCurry value is as stable as the real estate portfolio. 

Unlike traditional stablecoins RedCurry does not need to "steer" the peg. In case of a stablecoins, its holder never can rely on the existence of an actual full backing of the peg and thus when the "steering" goes "out of tune" with the collateral, the value will substantially change.

The above is achieved through careful decisionmaking and property selection for the portfolio that makes up the NAV. The real estate portfolio consists of no lump risk, “classical” commercial real estate with an established and functioning market. Top-quality properties, focus on cash flow rather than on fast capital appreciation. The decisionmaking is managed by a novel, highly transparent and lawful governance mechanism.

At the same time, then NAV is constantly published, all data, including audited and verifiable backing, is permanently availabe and the value can be verified by any holder at any time. As the holder of RedCurry has no redemption rights we mitigate the risk of a bank-run or malicious manipulation of driving the NAV up or down.



**Protocol**

As the speed of cryptocurrency trading compared to real estate is extensive, we have designed the protocol to be fractional, but fully backed. The total supply of RedCurry Token is backed by the The Net Asset Value (NAV) of the protocol’s real estate portfolio. Part (max 10%) of the NAV consists of Euro cash (EUR) and ~90% of commercial real estate. Cash part of the portfolio is intended solely for investments into real estate or for RedCurry Token buy backs. 

This treasury principle helps to compensate the difference between low frequency energy of real estate and high frequency energy of crypto markets. It also acts as a stability mechanism -
If RedCurry Token is trading above the NAV, the protocol enables to increase the collateral ratio of cash meant to be invested into real estate by opening up sales (minting). If RedCurry Token is trading below the NAV, the protocol enables the decrease of Euro cash collateral by opening up buy-backs. This may also lead to a possible disposal of real-estate assets and the consecutive burn of RedCurry Token. Based on on-chain data, and controlled by the smart contracts, this strategy enables for immediate arbitrage opportunity in both scenarios. Read more about Price Stability.

As the management of real estate itself naturally requires a centralized approach we have built the closest manifestation of a decentralized, transparent and legal real estate and treasury management structure. RedCurry’s fully transparent non-profit foundation, [INSERT FOUNDATION NAME] is located in Austria and is regulated by it’s private foundation laws. The foundation has been renounced and is governed solely by its bylaws. Every entity operating for the foundation including RedCurry must follow the bylaws of the foundation. RedCurry is poised to evolve, at least partially, into a decentralized anonymous organization (DAO) where the governance token is used for treasury (not necessarily specific real estate) decision making and possibly for collateral (read about FRAX’s fractional stablecoin and how they successfully use governance tokens as collateral to achieve value stability).
