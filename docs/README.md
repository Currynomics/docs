# Introduction
The monetary theory has for decades discussed ideas of new forms of money. While Bitcoin and others have built their concept on defined scarcity or algorithms, we have taken a fresh look at money in general and realized that it is time for a truly new type of money. Enter the universe of Currynomics and read [our manifesto](https://redcurry.co/manifesto) to understand our approach and discover Curries a new type of money.

Redcurry is our first Curry: the first digital currency fully linked to the Net Asset Value (NAV) of a commercial real estate portfolio. Why have we chosen real estate? Because it is a well-established asset category with a huge market volume, and at the same time provides for long-term price stability and good inflation protection.

Redcurry is non-inflationary, not volatile, appreciates compared to its reference currency (Euro), and is resistant to fiat currency inflation. Here is why:

* Redcurry is always minted at the current NAV per Redcurry token. The minting proceeds go in full to the treasury and are used for the acquisition of real estate. Thus, any new supply of Redcurry has zero impact on the value of Redcurry: it leads immediately to an increase in assets in the treasury (first cash, then real estate) and thus the NAV per Redcurry stays unchanged. Redcurry is therefore non-inflationary and non-diluting.
* The NAV of Redcurry is not volatile: it is based on the value of its commercial real estate portfolio. The value of these assets does not stay stable over multi-year periods (it often tends to increase), but it typically does not change much, if at all, over a period of a couple of months.
* The NAV of Redcurry is increasing even if the underlying assets are not changing in value. The reason is that the Redcurry treasury is not only receiving cash from minting but also for the commercial operation of the real estate assets, i.e., rental income. This income is reinvested into further real estate, automatically increasing the NAV. Redcurry is thus systematically appreciating.
* Real Estate tends to increase in value during times of inflation, and also rent income increases, as typically rent agreements are inflation-indexed. This provides double protection against inflation. Redcurry is resistant to Euro inflation.

Redcurry fully follows the Currynomics principles and is ultimately governed by the non-profit Currynomics Foundation, acting solely for the benefit of the Redcurry and Currynomics community. Read more about the functioning and the structure of Redcurry in the next chapter here(2).

Holding Redcurry in itself has its merits - itâ€™s smarter than cash and protects you from the effects of inflation. But there is a bigger picture: Redcurry is also an ecosystem for the development of numerous highly innovative use cases. Read our use-case section here(3) for more on the disruptive changes Redcurry can bring to various fields of business activity.


Redcurry is intended to be a general means of payment and store-of-value for everyone, so we made the project fully transparent, highly decentralized, and public domain. All relevant information relating to the assets will be permanently available online for everyone, not just the Redcurry token holders. And we will work with the best industry partners to have real estate values and balance sheets fully audited. Have a look at our information policy section here(7).

Redcurry is open-source, fully transparent, audited, permissionless, and on-chain. It is currently being implemented on Ethereum and other chains. Redcurry is governed by the Currinomics Foundation, but will gradually evolve toward a DAO. Read more about the Redcurry technology and the Currynomics governance token here(8).

With Redcurry we are opening the first chapter of a truly inspiring book. Redcurry will not remain solitary, but will soon be accompanied by other Curries, based on different assets, with new use cases and stories attached to them. Stay tuned for more to come.
