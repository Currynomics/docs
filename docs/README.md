# About

Redcurry ($REDC) is the first stable-value currency fully pegged to the Net Asset Value (NAV) of real estate. The goal of the Redcurry protocol is to provide a highly scalable, decentralized, stable hard money in place of fixed-supply digital assets like BTC or USDT. Redcurry is designed to truly commoditize real estate - a fully fungible economic resource. Redcurry is open-source, permissionless, and on-chain. Currently being implemented on Ethereum and other chains.

As a new asset class, Redcurry is a blend of securities and money. 

From the securities world you find:
- Return on investment (like a RE fund) through business exposure
- Definitiveness of investment (a share you bought you can sell, but not return to someone or redeem against something)

From the money world you find:
- Transferability (means of payment, not securities transaction)
- No rights, trust only

You trade the redemption right against the higher return. Similar to savings book concept: you wave your right to claim the deposit for a certain period of time (years) against a higher return. In case of RedCurry, you are waiving your right to claim the deposit possibly forever, and in exchange, you get a voluntary offer for redemption (our treasury) and the full transferability of the savings book itself. Why bother to draw down money from your savings book, if you can pay with the savings book itself?


**How is it different from tokenized real estate?**

Unlike tokenized real estate, the holder of REDC has no rights associated with the property backing it. Redcurry value is as stable as the real estate portfolio. That is why the portfolio consists of only the most high quality commercial real estate with all decisionmaking managed by a unique, highly transparent, governance mechanism. Redcurry, with its high liquidity, is designed for payments, trading and store of value or liquidity parking.


**Protocol**

As the speed of cryptocurrency trading compared to real estate is extensive, we have designed the protocol to be fractional, but fully backed. The total supply of REDC is backed by the The Net Asset Value (NAV) of the protocol’s real estate portfolio. Part (max 10%) of the NAV consists of Euro cash (EUR) and ~90% of commercial real estate. Cash part of the portfolio is intended solely for investments into real estate or for REDC buy backs. 

This treasury principle helps to compensate the difference between low frequency energy of real estate and high frequency energy of crypto markets. It also acts as a stability mechanism -
If REDC is trading above the NAV, the protocol enables to increase the collateral ratio of cash meant to be invested into real estate by opening up sales (minting). If REDC is trading below the NAV, the protocol enables the decrease of Euro cash collateral by opening up buy-backs. This may also lead to a possible decrease of real-estate assets and the consecutive burn of REDC. Based on on-chain data, and controlled by the smart contracts, this strategy enables for immediate arbitrage opportunity in both scenarios. Read more about Price Stability.

As the management of real estate itself naturally requires a centralized approach we have built the closest manifestation of a decentralized, transparent and legal real estate and treasury management structure. Redcurry’s fully transparent non-profit foundation, [INSERT FOUNDATION NAME] is located in Austria and is regulated by it’s private foundation laws. The foundation has been renounced and is governed solely by its bylaws. Every entity operating for the foundation including Redcurry must follow the bylaws of the foundation. Redcurry is poised to evolve, at least partially, into a decentralized anonymous organization (DAO) where the governance token is used for treasury (not necessarily specific real estate) decision making and possibly for collateral (read about FRAX’s fractional stablecoin and how they successfully use governance tokens as collateral to achieve value stability).
