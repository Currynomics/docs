# Redemption
> Buyback and RedCurry Token burning.

During turbulent market conditions when RedCurry Token price falls under the NAV, RedCurry will conduct a buyback at NAV value through its claim site. This creates an arbitrage opportunity for the market participants and acts as a price stabilization method. Read more about Price Stability.

The redemption of the RedCurry Token is followed by the burning of the token and is the reverse process of minting it. In other words, this means buying them back from the market at NAV and destroying them. This event will stabilize the market price when there is decreasing demand and price drops.
