# Token Distribution

The financial distribution partners of Redcurry (e.g. exchange) will distribute the tokens to their clients. The client can buy and sell at the distribution partner. It is therefore the partners, who are creating the market liquidity for the Redcurry token. The client holding the Redcurry token is therefore dependent on the conditions under which the partner is offering its services for REDC.

The client holding the Redcurry token (holder) is a passive token holder. In other words the holder cannot interact with the Holding in any way. Neither does the holder have any special information rights stemming from holding the toke and is a conscious decision - any and all information relating to the issuance and management of Redcurry is in the public domain (see Redcurry Information Policy).

As the Redcurry system has no expiration date, the token can be acquired or sold at any time and held indefinitely. The minting of new tokens can be repeated indefinitely at any time. The Holding may also, at any time, buy Redcurry tokens at the price of NAV and burn them. However, the Holding can never be obliged to do so â€“ with one exception: the Foundation board may, at a certain point in time, decide to end the Redcurry system as a whole and order the Holding to begin buying back any and all Redcurry tokens to burn them. In any case, each activity (buying back and burning or minting of Redcurry tokens) of the Holding, which is envisioned to become part of a decentralized anonymous organization (DAO), can only occur at the current Net Asset Value.
