# Governance
Redcurry governance falls into two broad jurisdictions:
 
1. Treasury management which includes price stability, token minting and redeeming, market making, collateral ratios, etc. Treasury management will be done by on-chain data and smart contracts as much as possible. The business requirements of treasury management will be governed by the Currinomics Foundation bylaws.
2. Real Estate management which includes the investment and divestment decisions considering the real estate. These decisions are made by the Redcurry Holding board which in turn is watched and governed by the Currinomics Foundation, according to its bylaws.

At the initial phase of Redcurry, the Currinomics Foundation bylaws were developed and set by the founding team, and made public. These bylaws cannot be changed. The founding team then appoints the Foundation board, who will in turn appoint the Redcurry Holding board members. Everyone involved, including the founding team, will be governed by the bylaws of the Foundation.
