# About
The Currynomics DAO (Decentralised Autonomous Organisation) is meant to catalyse and coordinate the open-source infrastructure and ecosystem of partners, builders, and users that simplifies, secures, and makes truly stable digital currencies and decentralised finance (DeFi) in general accessible for the masses.
 
To minimise the risk of human factors and preserve the DeFi commonsâ€™ fundamental ethos of permissionless access, the Currynomics ecosystem cannot be governed by a centralised entity.
 
Governance - separation of concerns. Due to the size of the Currynomics ecosystem which consists of the Currynomics DAO, Currynomics Foundation, individual Redcurry Holding, Currynomics Labs (operational), and other actors in the system, a clear separation of control and accountability must be established.
 
Our DAO has two main roles and its purpose is to give a voice to our community and influence the development and growth of the whole platform through the proposal management system and voting system.
 
The following are examples of what can be influenced by the DAO token holders[1]. 

DAO governance token holder can: 
* Have a say in the Currynomics Foundation management board.
* Have a say in DAO Treasury decisions.
* Have a say in governance and DAO processes.
* Decide on important community goals and targets.
* Measure sentiment on potential Executive Vote proposals.
* Ratify governance proposals originating from the community signals.
* Adjust global system parameters in a DAO protocol
* Adjust treasury-specific parameters in a DAO protocol
* Replace modular smart contracts in a DAO protocol
* Make certain upgrades to the system.
* Have a say in individual Curry tokenomics.
* Decide on the level of on-chain reporting:
    * For example, what data besides that which is needed for NAV calculation is to be published on a blockchain.
