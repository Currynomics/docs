# Introduction
Distributed ledger technology (DLT) like blockchain has gained significant popularity due to its decentralisation, security, and transparency features. Despite its potential, challenges persist in linking blockchain transactions to real-world objects and activities. Cryptographic tokens have emerged as a solution, representing assets or utilities within networks and enabling competition against centralised web2 platforms.

Tokens offer a variety of benefits, including innovative financing channels, functioning as internal currencies, and serving as the foundation for decentralised organisations such as Currynomics. However, the broad range of token functionalities necessitates careful tokenomic design to avoid negative consequences, such as those witnessed in the collapse of TerraUSD and others in 2022.

Currynomics aims to address these challenges by establishing a logical and professional basis for developing a resilient and sustainable token economy. This approach will ensure effective governance of Redcurry and all subsequent curries, ultimately realising the full potential of DLT technology.

# About
Currynomics is an innovative decentralised organisation dedicated to creating truly stable digital currencies and providing a secure store of wealth for open finance. Driven by the principles of liquidity, safety, sustainability, and governance, Currynomics aims to simplify, secure, and make decentralised finance accessible for everyone.
 
The Currynomics has two main roles and its purpose is to give a voice to our community and influence the development and growth of the whole platform through the proposal management system and voting system.

To minimise the risk of human factors and preserve the DeFi commonsâ€™ fundamental ethos of permissionless access, the Currynomics ecosystem cannot be governed by a centralised entity.

In order to structure the organisation in a way that avoids strong centralization and preserves the permissionless ethos of DeFi while minimising the risk of human factors, the Currynomics ecosystem consists of various entities, including the Currynomics, Currynomics Foundation, individual Redcurry Holding, and Currynomics Labs. To ensure clarity and accountability, a clear separation of control is established among these entities.
