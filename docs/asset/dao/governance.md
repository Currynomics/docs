# Governance
Governance in the blockchain context is crucial for decentralised systems to evolve over time, adapting to environmental changes and user preferences. Since there is no central decision-making body, it's essential to have a well-defined governance process. The importance of governance design in a token economy is widely acknowledged, and with substantial treasuries in decentralised token economies, examining governance systems and decision-making processes is vital.

Token economies, like nation states, need time to refine their governance structures, but blockchain ecosystems have only existed for a decade, and many governance issues remain unresolved. Governance mechanisms are used by communities to update the system and agree on plans in unexpected situations. The core questions this chapter is focusing on is how to design token economy governance, which explores the extent of governance decentralisation, the use of on-chain and off-chain governance components, and mechanisms for voting for governance proposals.

## Governance areas 
The broad governance areas of the DAO are as follows:

* Treasury management: Decisions related to the allocation and management of the DAO's treasury funds.
* Governance and Process: Decisions regarding the DAO's governance structure, voting processes, community goals, and community sentiment towards proposals.
* Protocol Upgrades: Decisions regarding the implementation of system upgrades, adjustments to global and treasury-specific parameters in the protocol, and replacement of modular smart contracts in the DAO protocol.
* Tokenomics: Decisions related to the design of tokenomics.
