# Governance

RedCurry governance falls into two broad jurisdictions: 
1. Treasury management which includes price stability, token minting and redeeming, market making, collateral ratios, etc. Treasury management will be done by on-chain data and smart contracts as much as possible. The business requirements of treasury management will be governed by the Currinomics Foundation bylaws. Read more about Treasury management.
2. Real Estate management which includes the investment and divestment decisions of real estate. These decisions are made by the RedCurry Holding board which in turn are watched and governed by the Currinomics Foundation according to its bylaws.

At the initial phase of RedCurry, Currinomics Foundation bylaws are developed and set by the founding team and made public. These bylaws cannot be changed. The founding team then appoints the Foundation board who will in turn appoint the RedCurry Holding board members. Everyone involved including the founding team will be governed by the the bylaws of the Foundation. 

The Currinomics Foundation can become a legal wrapped for the Currinomics DAO if a DAO strategy is pursued. In this case, a governance token could be used for voting on matters related to treasury and choosing representatives. Specific real estate and investment decisions will be left to the specialists in that field.
