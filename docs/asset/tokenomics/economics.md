# Redcurry Token vs Other Financial Instruments
Redcurry is not linked to any traded securities or other financial instruments, or any other volatile asset class. And it is not linked to assets that do not generate a positive cash flow or can generate a negative cash flow (storage cost), like precious metals, commodities, art, etc.
 
Redcurry is non-inflationary, stable, and appreciative compared to its reference currency (Euro), and is resistant to fiat currency inflation. As a fundamental principle, a Curry is only linked to such asset categories which are generating a continuous positive cash flow, have little volatility in value, and are based on physical long-term fixed assets. Such assets can be commercial real estate (as in Redcurry), agricultural land and forests, PV power plants and wind parks, electricity or gas distribution networks, toll highways or railroad tracks, etc.
 
The NAV of Redcurry is increasing, even if the underlying assets remain unchanged in value. The reason is that the Redcurry treasury is not only receiving cash from minting but also from the commercial operation of the real estate assets, i.e. rental income. This income is reinvested into additional real estate, automatically increasing the NAV. Real estate tends to increase in value during times of inflation, and also rental income increases, as typically rental agreements are inflation-indexed. This provides a double shield against inflation.
 
Therefore, holding Redcurry (REDC) in itself has merits - it’s smarter than cash, and protects you from the effects of inflation. And there is a bigger picture: Redcurry is also an ecosystem for the development of many highly innovative use cases. The first three main use cases are:
●  	Buy and hold (Real Estate investment and/or parking your capital into the stable asset); 
●  	Proptech use cases, Deposits, insurance, inflation protection
●  	Real asset collateral in DeFi protocols
