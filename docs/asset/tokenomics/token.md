## Token value
> Token value (NAV per token) = Net Asset Value / supply

Token value will be calculated by the NAV. NAV divided by the whole amount of minted tokens (supply) will give us the value of the token. 

For example, If the NAV is 2.22M€  and there are 2M minted tokens, the token value will be 2 220 000/2 000 000= 1.1€.

Value is different than price. Price will be dictated by market participants, value is calculated based on the Net Asset Value of the Real Estate portfolio.
