# Tokenomics
There will be two independent token systems. Firstly, the main, Redcurry token, which is a real estate based stable price asset, will be first issued by Currynomics family. To incentivise the community and assure the sustainability of the whole system, we have another token called the Currynomics DAO token. To offer the best of liquidity, safety, sustainability, and governance.

## Redcurry token
### Token value
The token value will be calculated by the NAV. NAV divided by the whole amount of minted tokens (supply) will give us the value of the token.
 
Token value (NAV per token) = Net Asset Value / supply
 
For example, If the NAV is 2.22M€  and there are 2M minted tokens, the token value will be 2 220 000/2 000 000= 1.1€.
 
Value is different from price. Price will be dictated by market participants, and value is calculated based on the Net Asset Value of the Real Estate portfolio.

### Token distribution
Redcurry tokens will be distributed to the public markets only by verified distribution partners (look at the distribution mechanism topic). Distribution partners will be Exchanges and/or brokers who are licensed and fully regulated in different legislative areas, and who have done the proper KYC for their customers.

### Transaction fee
From all REDC transactions, there will be a transaction fee of **0.02%** which goes into the DAO treasury and will be divided there by the DAO tokenomics, combined with the DAO Governance system.

### Token Liquidity
Liquidity of the token is essential to the design and will be developed in three ways:
 
1. Through the centralised distribution partners
2. Through our own managed Liquidity pool
3. Through third-party liquidity pools and secondary markets
