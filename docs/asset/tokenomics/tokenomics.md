## REDC vs Other Financial Instruments

Redcurry token REDC shall by no means be seen as an alternative to classical investments. If an investor considers a long-term investment in the real estate sector, he will achieve a higher return with a direct investment into real estate or by investing into a real estate fund, a REIT or a stock listed real estate company. While REDCURRY will apply the same diligence and professionalism in managing its real estate portfolio, the whole investment and operations strategy will be very different. It will not aim to maximize the return but at minimising volatility of its NAV.
