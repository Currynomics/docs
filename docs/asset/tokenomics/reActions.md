# Real Estate Deals And Impact On Token Value
## Acquisition of Real Estate
When the Holding acquires new real estate, only an internal movement of assets occurs, and thus such acquisition has no impact on the NAV, and therefore the token price.
In the following example, one can see that the token price will remain as long as the internal assets are exchanged between treasury cash and real estate.


Tokens in criculation: 3 000 000  
Treasury NAV:  
* Real Estate: € 2 000 000  
* Cash & receivables: € 1 120 000  
* Total: € 3 120 000  

**NAPT (Net Asset Per Token): € 1,04**

Investment ingress: € 1 040 000, new tokens minted: 1 000 000

Tokens in criculation: 4 000 000  
Treasury NAV: 
* Real Estate: € 2 000 000
* Cash & receivables: € 2 160 000
* Total: € 4 160 000  

**NAPT (Net Asset Per Token): € 1,04**
 
**Treasury cash overweight triggers RE investments.**

Tokens in criculation: 4 000 000  
Treasury NAV:  
* Real Estate: € 3 744 000
* Cash & receivables: € 416 000
* Total: € 4 160 000  

**NAPT (Net Asset Per Token): € 1,04**


## Operation With Real Estate
The Holding is continuously receiving cash inflow from rental income. In addition, the Holding is regularly evaluating its real estate assets and might record an appreciation or depreciation of the value of these assets. Both income and appreciation/depreciation, have an impact on the Net Asset Value: the income increases the Cash position, and the appreciation of value increases the real estate asset position.

There are plenty of other events which can also occur. For example, the Holding can invest money in the refurbishment of some premises to be able to rent them out for a higher price. In such a case, the cash position would reduce while the real estate asset position would increase.


## Sale of Real Estate
In principle, the sale of real estate should have no impact on the NAV, similar to the acquisition of real estate described above. However, it has to be assumed that the sale of real estate will not happen exactly at the last recorded asset value in the Holding, but at a transaction price more or less different from such asset value. The target of the management of the Holding will of course always be to achieve a transaction price higher than the last recorded asset value.
