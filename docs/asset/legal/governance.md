## Corporate Governance
Ethically correct behaviour shall be a principle on all levels of the organisation, from the Foundation down to the Property Manager. The benefit of the enterprise shall always have priority over personal interests. No kickbacks, provisions or other conflicts of interest shall be tolerated. The remuneration of the managers shall be fair and transparent, rather a bit on the generous side but with a strict enforcement of ethical standards. At the same time, the corporate governance shall not limit especially the Asset Managers to establish informal contacts with any market participants, with the aim to utilize such contacts to the benefit of the enterprise. With the growth of the organisation, the CEO shall decide on the supervision of the ethical standards of the company, potentially also with external support (but without drifting off into spying).

As Redcurry is a non-profit organisation, thriftiness is of high value. Thriftiness shall not mean being cheap or stingy but shall mean self-awareness of which expenses are necessary or reasonable, and which are not. Thriftiness means that self-adulation shall have no space in the organisation (e.g., no expensive self-presentation at industry events, even though visiting such events might be reasonable despite the associated expenses). Marketing shall only be carefully used as a tool, and solely for the purpose of promoting the Redcurry ecosystem. Sponsoring shall stay an exception, and if at all, only on a small scale and only for purposes with clear social aim (e.g., poverty alleviation, environmental protection, or health).

Egomania and self-adulation shall also have no space within the organisation. Everyone shall meet everyone with respect and with the aim of collaborative partnership. It counts what the team achieves, not what the individual achieves.
