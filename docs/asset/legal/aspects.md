# Legal Aspects
The fundamental concept behind Redcurry is to create an alternative means of payment that is appreciating but without making it a security. Holders of REDC will have a means of payment that does not cost them (through negative interest or cost of storage) but rather appreciates in value. To disqualify as a security, the Redcurry Token must be fully independent of the assets backing its value. Therefore, the holder of the Redcurry Token has no rights to any of the backed assets associated with the Token.
 
The definition of a security is outlined in the EU Market in Financial Instruments Directive ("MIFID2"); Redcurry does not fall under the definition of a security; this fact is confirmed by a detailed legal opinion. If Redcurry is not a security, it could be considered to be completely unregulated like a Utility Token. However, it is not the intention to keep Redcurry outside of any regulated market. Redcurry is meant to be an alternative to legal tender and therefore is an instrument of payment. Instruments of payment are regulated as well, however not by securities acts like MIFID2 but by banking sector acts. The Redcurry concept is designed to be in full compliance with such banking sector regulations, and therefore Redcurry is being distributed only through financial institutions licensed under the applicable banking sector acts.
