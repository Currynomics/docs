## RedCurry Holding
The RedCurry Holding is the central element of the RedCurry system. The RedCurry Holding performs a number of essential functions:

* Minting and burning of tokens
* Investment and divestment of real estate 
* Supervision of the Asset Management
* Ensuring of the calculation of the Net Asset Value
* Dissemination of full information about RedCurry and the entire organization.

The following chapters of this whitepaper is devoted to the deeper understanding of the real estate element in RedCurry and therefore many aspects of the above functions are described there (see Understanding the real estate element in RedCurry). Details on the relations between the Holding and the participating financial service providers are found in the chapter called RedCurry’s financial partners, where as deeper considerations on the process of minting and burning of RedCurry Tokens are described in the chapter called Economics of RedCurry. The focus in this chapter shall lie only on the general structure of the Holding and the processes within it. 

The Holding is a simple limited liability company; no special legal form or status is required. The Holding however does have very detailed articles of association reflecting the purpose of the Holding and how it is supposed to operate. All features of the Holding described in this document are regulated in a binding form either in the articles of association or the company’s bylaws, and the board of directors of the Foundation is responsible to ensure that they are obeyed and not changed. 

The Holding itself will not possess any properties. The Holding shall be completely independent of the individual properties, so that for each property the right legal and tax structure can be implemented, without consideration for other properties or the Holding itself. This means that the Holding is solely investing into real estate through the following actions 
founding a daughter company and purchasing the property with it (SPV) or 
acquiring a company, which already owns a property.
direct investments into real estate through third-party well established and stable real estate funds. 

It goes without saying that each of the investing companies will be domiciled in the country where the property is located. Furthermore, the principle of “one property, one legal entity” will be pursued as far as reasonably possible. It is a fundamental principle that all investments shall be fully “non-recourse”, which means that no legal entity, including the Holding itself, shall guarantee for any other legal entity within the RedCurry system. 

The Management of the Holding is conducted by the managing directors. The Holding will always have at least two managing directors with collective representation rights. The articles of association of the Holding do also foresee the possibility of the creation of a voluntary supervisory board, which will be implemented by the RedCurry Foundation once the RedCurry system has reached a size justifying such additional control level. Finally, the Holding does have a three-member advisory board comprising of real estate specialists. The advisory board is consulted for investment and divestment decisions and general strategic orientation of the investment policy of the Holding. 

The Holding is responsible for the whole financial management of the RedCurry System. This includes daily cash management of all subsidiaries and the Holding, drawing up of annual reports and the group financial statements, arranging for audit of all legal entities within the RedCurry System and employment of tax advisory services. The Holding aggregates all information collected and prepared by the Asset Management and ensures the writing of the main parts of this information, above all the Net Asset Value, to the Token. In addition, the Holding is also maintaining the information channels to the public. The central information element is the RedCurry website, which is operated by the Holding, and contains in-depth information about all operational matters of the RedCurry eco-system. This includes not only the number of Tokens and the NAV but also all underlying information relating to each real estate and the legal entities. The Holding Company will make as much information available as possible, and as soon as possible, to maximize the transparency as one of our core values.

Operationally, the Holding is of course oriented to generate profit. However, the business rationale is not to maximize the profit and distribute it to the shareholders of the company, like in a conventional business venture. The main objective is to ensure a continuous growth of the total asset value of the Holding with as little volatility as possible. Short term profit is therefore traded off against long term stable growth. It also goes without saying that growth of assets equals no distribution of profits. In the case of the RedCurry Holding a general prohibition of profit distributions is defined in the articles of association. Only minimal dividends, which may be necessary for covering strictly necessary expenses of the RedCurry Foundation, can be paid out. 

Another principle laid out in the articles of association is the primacy of economy, efficiency and expediency. The administrative structure of the Holding will be optimised to be only as large as absolutely necessary for proper operations of the system. The remuneration of the management of the Holding will be market adequate but not include any generous bonuses.
