# Overview
The Holding is the legal entity issuing the Redcurry Token (REDC). By the sale of the token, the Holding earns money, which it is obliged to invest solely into commercial real estate. To achieve the backing of the REDC by the real estate assets, it is imperative that no money or value can leave the Holding. For this purpose, the ownership structure above the Holding is created with a non-profit Foundation as the sole shareholder. The Foundation ensures that the Holding company does not distribute dividends and that the Holding either invests in real estate or ultimately buys back all REDC at the respective NAV, thus leaving no assets in the Holding or the Foundation. Ultimately the sales proceeds of all real estate owned by the Holding are the buy-back capital for the REDC.
 
As with a legal tender, Redcurry is issued without any associating rights. However, again like legal tender, behind Redcurry stands a structure ensuring its value. In the case of legal tender, the structure behind the currency typically is a National Bank. In the case of Redcurry, the structure is a two-level, effectively non-profit organisation:
 
Token are only distributed through licensed financial service providers such as banks or licenced exchanges, thus staying fully within the regulatory framework of a means of payment. Redcurry is only issued/minted by the Holding when demand for Redcurry is expressed by the participants and the Holding has opportunities to invest in suitable real estate. Therefore, the supply of Redcurry tokens reflects only the actual demand for the token and the Holding never accumulates cash positions (see How does it work?).
 
The Holding can only invest in commercial real estate; the specifics of the real estate to be acquired are defined in its statutes. Any proceeds from the operations of the real estate are fully re-invested and no profit distribution can occur. This way, at all times the NAV reflects the total of money invested and income generated within the Holding structure or the Redcurry system (see Redcurry Holding).
 
Token can only be issued/minted or destroyed/burned by the Holding and only at the actual Net Asset Value; therefore, no dilution of value can occur at any point of increase or decrease of supply of Redcurry (see Net Asset Value).
 
*The Holding is owned by a non-profit Foundation and the sole purpose of the Foundation is to maintain the Redcurry system. The Foundation has no beneficiaries, and the Foundation is not permitted to receive any profit distribution from the Holding, so no money leaves the Redcurry system (see Redcurry Foundation[2] ). At any time, the Holding can (but does not have to) destroy/burn REDC when there is an oversupply of tokens, or the Holding cannot invest in suitable real estate. Ultimately, the Holding can destroy/burn all issued Redcurry tokens, and as this only can occur at the respective NAV, the assets of the Holding decrease to zero with the last token being destroyed/burned.*

## Currynomics Foundation
The Currynomics Foundation is a Private Foundation under the Law of the Republic of Austria. Austrian Private Foundations are regulated by the so-called “Privatstiftungsgesetz” (Law on Private Foundations), which is legally in force since the 1990s. The application of this law enables the following arrangements:

Austrian Private Foundations are by virtue of law legal entities without any owner. Therefore, the management of the Austrian Private Foundation is only obliged to follow the regulations of the statutes of the Foundation and is not bound by the instructions or decisions of any shareholder.
Austrian Private Foundations have a “purpose” that can be freely defined. The Currynomics Foundation has as its sole purpose the maintenance of the Currynomics system. The purpose of the Foundation must be fulfilled by the Foundation’s board of directors at all times and as the sole objective. Non-compliance would be a breach of law and would be 
Statutes of Austrian Private Foundations can be made partly or fully unchangeable, and thus cannot be changed later even by the founder of the Foundation or the board of directors. The Currynomics Foundation is fully unchangeable. 
Statutes and by-laws of Austrian Private Foundations can regulate all activities of the Foundation and its board of directors to the smallest detail. Even “what if” regulations can be implemented, ensuring that the behavior of the Foundation follows exactly the original intentions of the founder. 
An Austrian Foundation does not only have any shareholders, but it can also foresee no beneficiaries, making it impossible to distribute any money or assets. The Foundation only must have a final beneficiary, who is receiving the proceeds of the liquidation of the Foundation. However, such liquidation can be conditional; in the case of Currynomics, the liquidation is conditional to a prior buy-back of any and all RedCurry Tokens at the respective Net Asset Value, leaving factually no assets for distribution to the final beneficiary. 

The Currynomics Foundation does not have any operative function in the RedCurry system. Its objective is to supervise the activities of the Holding and, when necessary, exercise its shareholder rights. The operative business is taking place in RedCurry Holding. However, the Currynomics Foundation is the watchdog ensuring that the RedCurry system is fulfilling its objectives. Therefore, the board of directors of the Currynomics Foundation needs to be composed of trustworthy and reputable persons, who are competent enough to supervise the activities of the Holding. The procedures for the election of the board of directors are outlined in the Foundation deed.

It is essential to understand that the Currynomics Foundation is de facto a non-profit structure. The Foundation is not entitled to receive any dividends from RedCurry Holding (except for minimal amounts to cover the mandatory cost of the Foundation) and aside from exercising its rights as a shareholder of RedCurry Holding and supervising it, it has no commercial activities at all. The Foundation is thus ensuring that no assets leave RedCurry Holding and thus the RedCurry system. Therefore, also the necessary costs of Currynomics Foundation are kept at a minimal level. 

As Currynomics Foundation has no own business activity and is not allowed to enter into any financial obligations or other risks, it can be safely assumed that the Foundation never can become insolvent. Therefore, the only scenario for the ending of the activity of the Foundation is its voluntary liquidation, which would have to be decided upon by the board of directors and in line with the regulations of the Foundation deed. In case of liquidation, RedCurry Holding would have first to sell all of its assets, buy back all RedCurry Tokens at the Net Asset Value and burn them, and then be liquidated. As a result, practically no assets would be left to be distributed to the Foundation and thus in case of the liquidation of the Currynomics Foundation itself, practically no assets at all can be left for final distribution.

## Redcurry Holding
The Holding is responsible for the financial management of Redcurry system. This includes daily cash management of all subsidiaries and of the Holding, drawing up annual reports and the group financial statements, arranging for the audit of all legal entities within the Redcurry system, and employment of tax advisory services. The Holding aggregates all information collected and prepared by the Asset Management and ensures the writing of the main parts of this information, above all the Net Asset Value, to the Token. In addition, the Holding is also maintaining the information channels to the public.
 
The central information element is the Redcurry website, which is operated by the Holding, and contains in-depth information about all operational matters of the Redcurry ecosystem. This includes not only the number of REDC and the NAV but also all underlying information relating to each real estate property and the legal entities. The Holding Company will make as much information available as possible, and as soon as possible, to maximize transparency as one of our core values.
 
The Holding is the central element of the Redcurry system. The Holding performs several essential functions:
 
1. Minting and burning of tokens
2. Investment and divestment of real estate
3. Supervision of the Asset Management
4. Ensuring the calculation of the Net Asset Value
5. Dissemination of full information about Redcurry and the entire organization.

The Holding is a simple limited liability company; no special legal form or status is required. The Holding however does have very detailed articles of association reflecting the purpose of the Holding and how it is supposed to operate. The Holding itself will not possess any properties and shall be completely independent of the individual properties so that for each property the right legal and tax structure can be implemented, without consideration for other properties or the Holding itself. This means that the Holding is solely investing in real estate through the following actions:
 
A. founding a daughter company and purchasing the property with it (SPV) or

B. acquiring a company, which already owns a property.

C. direct investments into real estate through third-party, well-established and stable real estate funds.
 
Each of the investing companies will be domiciled in the country where the property is located. Furthermore, the principle of “one property, one legal entity” will be pursued as far as reasonably possible. It is a fundamental principle that all investments shall be fully “non-recourse”, which means that no legal entity, including the Holding itself, shall guarantee for any other legal entity within the Redcurry system.
 
The Management of the Holding is conducted by the managing directors. The Holding will always have at least two managing directors with collective representation rights. The articles of association of the Holding also foresee the possibility of the creation of a voluntary supervisory board, which will be implemented by the Redcurry Foundation once the Redcurry system has reached a size justifying such additional control. Finally, the Holding does have a three-member advisory board composed of real estate specialists. The advisory board is consulted for investment and divestment decisions, and general strategic orientation of the investment policy of the Holding.
 
While the Holding is oriented toward generating profit, the business rationale is not to maximize the profit and distribute it to the shareholders of the company, as in a conventional business venture. The main objective is to ensure continuous growth of the total asset value of the Holding with as little volatility as possible. Short-term profit is therefore traded off against long-term stable growth, and a general prohibition of profit distribution is defined in the articles of association. Only minimal dividends, which may be necessary for covering strictly necessary expenses of the Redcurry Foundation, can be paid out.
 
Another principle laid out in the articles of association is the primacy of economy, efficiency and expediency. The administrative structure of the Holding will be optimised to be only as large as is necessary for the proper operations of the system. The remuneration of the management of the Holding will be market adequate and not include any generous bonuses.
