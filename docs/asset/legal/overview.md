# Legal Structure
> Foundation, holding, and financial partners.

## Overview
The RedCurry Holding, a legal entity owned by the Currinomics Foundation, is going to issue RedCurry Tokens via payment agents. Holding uses the funds received from issuing Tokens for establishing a real estate portfolio. Holding shall manage the portfolio and establish subsidiaries (SPV-s) to manage each real estate separately. The Holding would receive revenue from regular portfolio management via rent payments and real estate sales that shall be used to purchase additional real estate objects. Thus, the Holding reinvests its income and continuously increases in value. RedCurry Token owners can use it as a means of payment, store of value or exchange it for other cryptocurrencies or fiat at cryptocurrency exchanges.

To achieve the backing of the RedCurry Token by the real estate assets, it is imperative that no money or value can leave the Holding. For this purpose, the ownership structure above the Holding is created with a non-profit Foundation as the sole shareholder. The Foundation ensures that the Holding company does not distribute dividends and that the Holding either invests in real estate or ultimately buys back all RedCurry Tokens at the respective Net Asset Value, thus leaving no assets in the Holding or the Foundation. Ultimately the sales proceeds of all real estate owned by the Holding are the buy-back capital for the RedCurry Token. A deeper look at the Foundation and the Holding reveals why this structure is effectively ensuring the above.

Like a legal tender, RedCurry is emitted without any associating rights. However, again like legal tender, behind RedCurry stands a structure ensuring its value. In the case of a legal tender, the structure behind the currency typically is a National Bank. In the case of RedCurry, the structure is a two-level, effectively non-profit organization.

### Group Structure
The real estate portfolio is comprised of SPV-s, one for each real estate, wholly owned by the Holding.   
Holding distributes RedCurry and manages the real estate portfolio. The real estate portfolio together with the issued RECURR forms an ecosystem (RedCurry Ecosystem‚Äù). Holding Company is the sole owner of all SPV-s. All proceeds from RedCurry distribution are used for purchase of real estate (through SPV-s). An Austrian Foundation is the sole owner of the Holding Company.


**The RedCurry structure has several specific features:**
* RedCurry is only distributed through licensed financial service providers like banks or licensed exchanges, thus staying fully within the regulatory framework of a means of payment.
* RedCurry is only issued/minted by the Holding when:  
1. demand for RedCurry is expressed by the participants and  
2. the Holding has opportunities to invest in suitable real estate. Therefore, the supply of RedCurry tokens reflects only the actual demand for the token and the Holding never accumulates cash positions.
* The Holding can only invest in commercial real estate; the specifics of the real estate to be acquired are defined in its statutes. Any proceeds from the operations of the real estate are fully re-invested and no profit distributions occur. This way the Net Asset Value reflects at all times the total of money invested and income generated within the Holding structure or the RedCurry system (see RedCurry Holding).
* RedCurry can only be issued/minted or destroyed/burned by the Holding and only at the actual Net Asset Value; therefore, no dilution of value can occur at any point of increase or decrease of supply of RedCurry (see Net Asset Value)
* The Holding is owned by a non-profit Foundation. The sole purpose of the Foundation is to maintain the RedCurry system. The Foundation has no beneficiaries, and the Foundation is not permitted to receive any profit distribution from the Holding. By this, it is ensured that no money leaves the RedCurry system (see RedCurry Foundation).
* At any time, the Holding can (but does not have to) destroy/burn RedCurry tokens when there is an oversupply of tokens, or the Holding cannot invest in suitable real estate. Ultimately, the Holding can destroy/burn all issued RedCurry tokens, and as this only can occur at the respective NAV, the assets of the Holding decrease to zero with the last token being destroyed/burned.
