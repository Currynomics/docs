# Oracle
An oracle’s role is to verify, audit and transport to DeFi services the Redcurry’s token value (NAPT) and supply, treasury NAV, and other necessary information. These DeFi services can be lending platforms using Redcurry as collateral or decentralized exchanges trading with Redcurry to name a few. Together with the existing Redcurry system, this collaboration with third-party oracles can provide a transparent and decentralized way to transport the real value of Redcurry token with high uptime, security, and trust.

## Input
The input to the oracle comes from the Proof or Reserves, Token, and Governor Smart Contracts where a publicly auditable and immutable trail of the supply and asset changelog has been published by a decentralized group of people.

* The input to the oracle can be the following:
* Individual assets and their essential information (from POR contract)
* Individual asset NAV (from POR contract)
* Total NAV (from POR and Governor contract)
* Total Redcurry supply (from the Governor and Token contract)

## Output
The oracle can propagate the input directly to other DeFi services and dApps or conduct its own NAV calculations to derive the NAPT.

## Oracle Roles
The oracle also appoints third-party auditors or works with Currynomics Foundation auditors, to verify the source of data (accounting data) and the processes and technology used by the Redcurry system to report and track its assets.
