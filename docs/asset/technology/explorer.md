# Redcurry Explorer
Redcurry explorer is a web3 application designed to provide a window into the assets that are backing the Redcurry token. The dashboard shows all the assets and their changelog, their respective NAV and the token supply on a single dashboard.

The following is a screenshot view of the dashboard welcome screen.

Each asset has its own details view, there anybody can see the history of the asset changes.

As the assets are red directly from the blockchain, the same details can be confirmed using a public blockchain explorer (e.g.polygonscan.com) by searching for the Proof Of Reservers smart contract address).
