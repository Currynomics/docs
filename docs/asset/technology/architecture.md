# Architecture
For running the Redcurry asset management infrastructure, the goal is to publish (make public) the most important information used for the treasury net asset value (NAV) calculations.

The main purpose of an on-chain asset tracking system is to introduce transparency, decentralization, and immutability into the otherwise seemingly centralized accounting systems of a fund. Another reason for on-chain asset tracking is to progress towards a fully trustless, and ultimately fully decentralized reporting, governance, and decision-making system.

To better understand the requirements set on Redcurryâ€™s asset tracking architecture, read the [ASSET MANAGEMENT SECTION](/asset/treasury/treasury.md).

Redcurry currency token is pegged to the NAV. Any change to the NAV without updates to supply will affect the currency's price. It is then important for Redcurry to publish both the NAV and Supply on a decentralized, distributed, immutable, and trustless system - a public blockchain in a naturally decentralized way - distributed asset managers. 

It would make little sense to use decentralized systems only to find full centralization at the data source. This is why the essential pieces of information, which are needed for NAV calculations, are derived from large amounts of accounting data, managed and published by a decentralized group of people in a publicly auditable manner.

Redcurry is open-source, fully transparent, audited, permissionless, and on-chain. It is currently being implemented on Polkadot[1] and other chains. Redcurry is governed by the Currinomics Foundation, but will gradually evolve towards a Decentralised Autonomous Authority (DAO).
 
Redcurry is intended to be a general means of payment and store-of-value for everyone, so we made the project fully transparent and public domain. All relevant information relating to the assets will be permanently available on- and off-chain for everyone, not just the Redcurry token holders. We are working with the leading industry partners to have real estate values and balance sheets fully audited. Have a look at our information policy section here.
