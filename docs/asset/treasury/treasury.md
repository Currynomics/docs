# Treasury management
> Treasury Governed by the Currynomics Foundation.

All cash (both Euro and stablecoins) in the Holding treasury is considered part of the NAV as it is prescribed to be used solely for real estate investments. It is foreseen that the Holding then invests the majority of the cash, with some kept in treasury as a stability mechanism, into high-quality commercial real estate. The activity of investing in commercial real estate (CRE) is done to generate rental income and aims to achieve a continuously growing net asset value with a focus on minimal volatility. The Holding is obliged to optimize the growth of the NAV. Read more about Net Asset Value. In the beginning, RedCurry holding is managing the main treasury, whose size depends on the size of the whole real estate fund. The cash treasury starts with 10% of the size of assets under management.

RedCurry holding manages an internal treasury to compensate for the difference between the peculiarities of crypto trading (often fast energy) and real-estate transactions (often slow, can take weeks). In other words, the treasury acts as a buffer between RedCurry sales (minting) and investment of the proceeds into real estate. Treasury is also used in case buybacks are required. 

The treasury is considered, together with the real-estate portfolio, as part of the total assets under management (AUM) and is calculated into the net asset value (NAV) of the holding. Consisting of Euros, it is intended to be invested into real estate directly or through indirect investments like RE funds.

The treasury size is capped at 10% of the total NAV until the AUM grows over 10M Euro. After this, the treasury size is recalibrated by the Holding company as necessary for the optimal pegging to the NAV. The treasury size is mostly affected by the demand for the token and its volatility. When the treasury size reaches the threshold, no more REDUCRRY tokens will be sold and thus minted. A large part of the treasury managed will have to see that situation happens seldomly as the goal is to keep an even balance of the treasury - not too high, not too low.

## Low treasury cash situation.
> When treasury cash is invested into real estate.

Pipelined real estate investment opportunity is realized. New token generation even is organized by RedCurry following minting and sales of RedCurry Token. The consecutive cash received is invested into real estate. That which is not immediately invested, will remain in treasury and considered as part of the NAV. 

## Treasury accounts
Treasury will be managed by the holding company in one or many international bank accounts. All treasury activities including the accounts and SPVs are audited by independent external auditing firms while the everyday activity is overseen by the Currinomics Foundation.
