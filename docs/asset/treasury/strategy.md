# Investment Strategy
> Stability and Long-Term Value

The primary objective of Redcurry is to provide investors with a value-appreciating alternative characterized by low volatility. To achieve this, Redcurry Holding will base its investment strategy on commercial properties with stable, long-term cash flows. Speculative real estate developments and land-banking projects will be avoided, and preference will be given to properties secured by lengthy, unbreakable lease contracts.

To ensure long-term cash flow, Redcurry Holding will consider factors such as building design, current rent income levels, and operating costs. A focus on diversification will help minimize cluster risk, resulting in a preference for buildings with multiple strong tenants rather than a single tenant. The overall property size should also be balanced in relation to the entire property portfolio.

Redcurry Holding aims to establish a geographically diverse portfolio, investing only in EU countries with Euro-denominated or Euro-pegged rental agreements. The chosen properties will be from real estate sectors with numerous market participants. Unlike some real estate market participants, Redcurry Holding will avoid "trophy assets" and focus on secondary cities with strong economic growth. Properties requiring major refurbishment or market repositioning will not be considered, as they would introduce volatility.

In summary, Redcurry Holding's investment strategy is guided by the following principles:

1. Low risk: Focus on long-term cash flow and core/core+ properties; preference for multi-tenant buildings.
2. Long-term: Emphasize stable cash flow with minimal tenancy fluctuations; avoid speculative turn-around investments; adopt a long-term hold strategy.
3. Independent: Base acquisitions and disposals solely on management's response to market developments, without stakeholder influence on the real estate portfolio.

## Development strategy
> A Multi-Stage Approach

The Redcurry investment development strategy outlines a three-stage plan for managing investments based on monthly token sales. Stage 1 focuses on acquiring shares of the real estate fund shares, Stage 2 prioritizes club deals, direct investments, and further share acquisitions, and Stage 3 emphasizes direct investments and acquisitions, along with a more limited focus on acquiring shares. The strategy also sets maximum cash accumulation periods before making new investments for each stage.

### Stage 1: Token Sales Below €1M

During this stage, all funds will be directed towards the acquisition of real estate fund shares shares. This stage is expected to last until €10-20 million worth of tokens have been sold, after which the pace of sales should accelerate and lead to the subsequent stages.

### Stage 2: Token Sales Between €1M and €5M

In this stage, the priorities for investment allocation are as follows:

1. Club deals with real estate fund shares.
2. Direct investments via Asset Management Partners.
3. Acquisition of shares of real estate fund shares or other funds.

The maximum cash accumulation period before the next investment is set at six months.


### Stage 3: Token Sales Above €5 Million
When token sales exceed €5 million per month, the investment priorities shift to:

1. Direct investments through Asset Management Partners.
2. Club deals with real estate fund shares.
3. Direct investments executed by the internal team.
4. Acquisition of shares of real estate fund shares or other funds (limited extent).

For this stage, the maximum cash accumulation period before the next investment is limited to 3-4 months.

By following these investment priorities and adapting to the amount of money raised through monthly token sales, Redcurry Holding can make smart, strategic investments.
