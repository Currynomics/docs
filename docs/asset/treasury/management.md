# Treasury management
The treasury acts as a buffer between Redcurry sales (minting) and investment of the proceeds into real estate, and is also used in case buybacks are required. All cash (both Euro and stablecoins) in the Holding treasury is considered part of the NAV, as it is prescribed to be used solely for real estate investments and buy-back of Redcurry tokens (REDC).
 
It is foreseen that the Holding then invests the majority of the cash, with some kept in treasury as a stability mechanism, into high-quality commercial real estate. The activity of investing in Commercial Real Estate (CRE) is done to generate rental income and aims to achieve a continuously growing net asset value with a focus on minimal volatility.
 
The treasury is considered, together with the real-estate portfolio, as part of the total assets under management (AUM) and is calculated into the net asset value (NAV) of the holding. Consisting of Euros, it is intended to be invested into real estate directly or through indirect investments like RE funds.
 
The treasury size is capped at 10% of the total NAV until the AUM grows over 10M Euro. After this, the treasury size is recalibrated by the Holding company as necessary for the optimal token peg to NAV. The treasury size is mostly affected by the demand for the token and its volatility. When the treasury size reaches the threshold, no more Redcurry tokens will be sold and thus minted. A large part of the treasury management will be to ensure such a situation rarely happens as the goal is to keep an even balance of the treasury - not too high, not too low.
 
If treasury cash runs low from buying real estate, then a pipelined real estate investment opportunity is executed. This means that a new token generation event is organised by Redcurry including minting and sales of REDC. The consecutive cash received is then invested into real estate. That which is not immediately invested, will remain in the treasury and be considered as part of the NAV.
The Treasury will be managed by the Holding company in one or many international bank accounts. All treasury activities including the accounts and SPVs are audited by independent external auditing firms while the everyday activity is overseen by the Currinomics Foundation.
