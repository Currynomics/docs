# Treasury management
The treasury acts as a buffer between Redcurry sales (issuing) and investment of the minting proceeds into real estate, and is also used in case buybacks of Redcurry tokens are intended. All cash in the treasury is cash owned by the Redcurry Holding and thus by default part of the NAV.

Typically, the Redcurry Holding will sell (mint) new tokens, when it has opportunities to invest into new high-quality commercial real estate. It will however not mint tokens only because there is demand for new tokens. Rather, Redcurry Holding will aim at keeping the treasury in balance, which means that the cash position of the treasury does not exceed certain thresholds. This is making the Redcurry token non-inflationary.

The aim is to keep 10% of the total NAV in cash in the treasury. In the initial growth period of Redcurry, when the assets under management are below 100 Mill EUR, the treasury might at some point of time also hold more than 10%, but in the long-run the 10% threshold will be aimed at. 

The treasury will mint and sell new tokens whenever the cash position in the treasury falls significantly below 10% of NAV, typically because cash from the treasury was spent for a real estate investment. In case of a planned large investment, minting of tokens might occur even when the treasury has 10% of NAV in cash.

The treasury will buy and burn tokens using its cash holding position whenever an oversupply of Redcurry tokens occurs. In case of a long-term oversupply of Redcurry tokens (measured in weeks or months), Redcurry Holding will decide to sell a property or investment to refill the treasury cash position and then potentially buy and burn even more tokens. 
Both, minting and selling of new tokens or buying and burning of tokens, can always occur only at the current NAV per token price level. Therefore, at no point of time the sale or purchase of tokens by the treasury will influence the NAV and therefore no dilution of Redcurry token holders can occur.
