# Real Estate Management
## RE Strategy
The objective of Redcurry is to provide a cash holder with a value-appreciating alternative (at least to a certain extent) without major volatility. As the value of Redcurry is derived from the Net Asset Value of its real estate portfolio, the investment strategy of Redcurry Holding has to be chosen in such a way that these objectives of Redcurry are assured. Redcurry Holding will invest only in such properties which already have a stable cash flow, and/or can be expected to continue to produce a stable cash flow in the long run. Redcurry Holding will therefore not invest in speculative real estate developments or land-banking projects and will prefer objects with long-term cash flow secured by long, unbreakable lease contracts.
 
Related to the current cash flow is also the suitability of a building for achieving long-term cash flow. This includes factors like the design of the building (is it flexible enough to provide suitable space for different types of tenants?), the current rent income level (is the level of rental income compared to the market such that it is easy to find new tenants at the same, or even higher, price level?), or the operating costs of the building (how much cash flow from rental income is lost for non-recoverable expenses?).
 
To avoid volatility, it will also be important for Redcurry Holding to avoid substantial cluster risk. This means that a building with several strong tenants is generally more favourable than one with only one single tenant and that the size of each property should not be too big in relation to the whole portfolio of properties.
 
Redcurry Holding will aim to have a geographically diverse portfolio, and investment spread in different real estate sectors. However, the investments will be only domiciled in EU countries, with Euro-denominated or Euro-pegged rental agreements, and the properties will be only selected from real estate sectors with a large volume of market participants. Also, the long-term focus means that the choice of properties will not necessarily be comparable with that of some other real estate market participants. Redcurry Holding will not need to invest in so-called "trophy assets”, Redcurry Holding will also be ready to invest in secondary cities, which are experiencing strong economic growth and might not yet be a large submarket for transactions. And Redcurry Holding will not invest in buildings that require, in the near future, a major refurbishment or market repositioning, as this would bring volatility to the Net Asset Value.

In summary, the investment strategy of Redcurry Holding is based on the following key principles:

* Low risk: long-term cash-flow is more important than short-term asset value appreciation, therefore preferably core / core+ properties shall be acquired; multi-tenant buildings preferred
* Long-term: stable cash-flow with low tenancy fluctuation is prime, no speculative turn-around investments; long-term hold strategy
* Independent: no influence of stakeholders on real estate portfolio, hence acquisitions and disposals are only driven by management response to market development


## Creating The Portfolio
Redcurry Holding is the legal entity investing into real estate. However, Redcurry Holding will be a pure investment holding without any real-estate-related operative activities. All investments will be indirect, either through subsidiaries (special purpose vehicles - SPVs) or non-listed real estate funds.

The income generated on the level of the SPVs or the funds will be distributed as much as possible to the level of the Redcurry Holding, typically in the form of dividends or repayment of own equity. The SPVs will hold only so much liquidity, as is necessary for their day-to-day operations and the repayment of liabilities (if any).

The SPVs will have only a minimal share capital. All other equity will be provided (if possible) by contributions to capital reserves or similar structures so that equity can easily be returned if there is sufficient liquidity.

All SPVs will in all cases be structured as fully non-recourse i.e., no guarantees of any kind to other group companies or third parties.

Real estate will be acquired by asset deals or share deals. As the intention is to hold real estate for a long period, latent capital gains taxes may be accepted with a market standard discount. Real estate transactions may also include more than one property, however, preference will be given to the principle of “one SPV – one property”

To avoid lump risks, properties acquired will not be too big concerning the total real estate portfolio. The aim should be that once the portfolio size reaches 500M Euro or more, a single property (but not necessarily a single transaction) shall constitute not more than 10% of the total portfolio value. Balancing of risks over properties, markets and regions shall be ensured.

The acquisition of properties will be managed through three channels: direct acquisition with own acquisition managers (SPV acquiring is 100% owned by Redcurry Holding), indirect acquisition by employment of an external asset manager (SPV acquiring is 75%-100% owned by Redcurry Holding) or indirect acquisition through certain non-listed real estate funds (Redcurry Holding owning a fraction of the fund, could be 1% up to 50%).
