# Real Estate Management
## Creating The Portfolio
Redcurry Holding is the legal entity investing into real estate. However, Redcurry Holding will be a pure investment holding without any real-estate-related operative activities. All investments will be indirect, either through subsidiaries (special purpose vehicles - SPVs) or non-listed real estate funds.

The income generated on the level of the SPVs or the funds will be distributed as much as possible to the level of the Redcurry Holding, typically in the form of dividends or repayment of own equity. The SPVs will hold only so much liquidity, as is necessary for their day-to-day operations and the repayment of liabilities (if any).

The SPVs will have only a minimal share capital. All other equity will be provided (if possible) by contributions to capital reserves or similar structures so that equity can easily be returned if there is sufficient liquidity.

All SPVs will in all cases be structured as fully non-recourse i.e., no guarantees of any kind to other group companies or third parties.

Real estate will be acquired by asset deals or share deals. As the intention is to hold real estate for a long period, latent capital gains taxes may be accepted with a market standard discount. Real estate transactions may also include more than one property, however, preference will be given to the principle of “one SPV – one property”.

To avoid lump risks, properties acquired will not be too big concerning the total real estate portfolio. The aim should be that once the portfolio size reaches 500M Euro or more, a single property (but not necessarily a single transaction) shall constitute not more than 10% of the total portfolio value. Balancing of risks over properties, markets and regions shall be ensured.

The acquisition of properties will be managed through three channels: 
1. direct acquisition with own acquisition managers (SPV acquiring is 100% owned by Redcurry Holding), 
2. indirect acquisition by employment of an external asset manager (SPV acquiring is 75%-100% owned by Redcurry Holding) or 
3. indirect acquisition through certain non-listed real estate funds (Redcurry Holding owning a fraction of the fund, could be 1% up to 50%).

## Property and Personnel Preferences
* Preference for buildings which have no lump risk (i.e., rather not single-tenant buildings)
* Preference for “classical” commercial real estate with an established and functioning market, rather than “specialty” real estate
* High-quality properties: quality is more important than rental yield, however, no “trophy hunting”; focus rather on cash flow than on fast capital appreciation. The long-term usability and functionality of the properties are important, therefore no buildings with demanding and not practical architecture, but rather functional buildings with high technical standards.
* ESG is important, however not an excuse for neglecting other quality criteria of a property
* Investment focus on Europe, especially on well-performing markets, which are strategically interesting in the long run, and not on hyped markets with a clear downturn risk. “We don’t have to be where the party is.”
* Balanced regional risk spread with a clear focus on CEE and Tier-2-cities. Cash-Flow and stability of the market have preference over “fame”. 

The management of the Holding will initially be provided by the Management Company (also the initial IP holder and seed investment facilitation body) but shall – as soon as financially meaningful and practical – be built up within the holding company. The functions of the Holding are: 

* Finance: finance management and liquidity planning, tax optimization, group consolidation
* Information: active information management to the public
* Portfolio: transaction management and supervision of asset management

The Holding will be managed by a CEO with a strong legal background, a CFO with a solid accountancy background, and a CIO with hands-on experience in transaction and asset management. The CIO should also be a member of the Investment Committee. 

All group companies shall have collective signatory rights. The level of the SPVs will include the CIO (or a team member) and the Asset Manager. For daily operations, POAs may be given to the Asset Manager, to act alone.

The budgeting process will be bottom-up: Asset Manager and Property Manager prepare a budget for each property; the consolidation and feedback loop happens on the level of the Holding.

The organization of the whole group shall be very lean, especially concerning office management, personal assistants, and alike.

## Investment Committee
The Investment Committee shall serve as an advisory body to the Holding company. The Investment Committee shall approve investment plans (what type of properties to acquire in which regions and at what price levels), discuss investment strategies (e.g., overweighing or underweighting certain asset categories or markets) and approve heads of terms of intended transactions. 

The Investment Committee shall be composed of a few real estate experts with a deep knowledge of the relevant real estate markets. These persons would typically work for a large real estate advisory firm in a high management position (preferably Head of Capital Markets or Managing Partner). They should not be competitors (i.e., working for large real estate investors) or from industries with only limited knowledge of the market conditions (e.g., from banking). 

## Incentivisation Schemes
As the functioning of the Redcurry system is to a certain extent a public function and not a simple profit maximization scheme, the responsibilities and this also the incentivization of the managers are different from ordinary real estate investment companies. 

**On the level of the Holding management, the following KPIs are decisive:**  
* Gradually increasing NAV with minimized volatility
* Maintenance of continuous growth of interest in Redcurry
* Safety and security of Redcurry operations in the market
* Accuracy and depth of information provided to the market
* Effectivity of the organization (minimize expenses as a percentage of NAV resp. rent income)
* Development of long-term investment strategy, in relation to properties but also the amount of Redcurry in circulation

At the level of the Asset Managers, the incentivization shall focus even more on the continuity of operations of each property, i.e., low vacancy, low fluctuation of tenants, growing cash flow with minimal volatility, and cost-efficiency.
