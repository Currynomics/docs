# Real Estate Valuation

## Valuation Principles
The Redcurry valuation methodology is based on the acquisition value of each property. Each property will be recorded at full acquisition cost (including transaction costs) and this value will not be subject to annual depreciation, as typically required under local GAAP rules. We call this value the Original Acquisition Value (OAV).

Once per year, for each property a market valuation will be performed: typically this will be an external Market Price valuation based on standard valuation rules (RICS), occasionally supplemented by one internal valuation based on replacement Cost Approach. The acquisition values of the properties will then be compared with the average of the valuations; if the valuation of a certain property is equal to or higher than the acquisition value, then nothing happens, and the acquisition value remains unchanged. However, if the valuation is below the acquisition value, then the acquisition value will be corrected downwards by such difference. This difference we call the Original Acquisition Value Impairment (OAVI). The rule is then that if the market value is below OAV then OAVI is set so that OAV - OAVI equals to the market value.

The OAVI will be recorded as long as the market valuations remain below the OAV and OAVI will be adapted each year to reflect the most recent difference. Once the market valuation exceeds again the OAV, the correction will be set to zero.
In case of long-term investments into the building, the OAV will be increased accordingly by the amount of such investments. Such investments will include replacement of technical components (e.g., change of elevator), however will not include simple repairs and not minor investments. The annual comparison of market valuations versus OAV will of course be performed always against the latest OAV as increased by recorded investments.

The application of the above principles ensures that:
* the NAV does not fluctuate because of short-term market movements on the real estate markets, but stay stable
* the NAV is never overvalued as any negative market movements, which push the market price below the OAV are immediately being recorded; there might however be periods where the NAV is undervalued
* the long-term, the OAV is not remaining unchanged, due to recording of necessary long-term investments; therefore, a potential substantial undervaluation will be caught up in the long run by the increases of the OAV

## Trust in real estate values
The application of the above described principle with tracking of OAV and testing it against market prices does not only reduce volatility in the NAV, it also ensures long-term trust into the NAV.

The starting point, the OAV, is always a fact - the money actually spent for a transaction, and recorded in the accounting of the Redcurry Holding as well as on chain, is not an opinion on the value of a property but an objective fact. As all investment decisions in Redcurry Holding will be discussed and ultimately approved by an external investment committee, there will be no reason to assume that a certain property would be massively overpaid at acquisition. The OAV will therefore more or less equal the market value at acquisition and thus the NAV will be objectively correct and trustworthy.

Any future change to the OAV can only occur through an investment, which is associated with a cash payment. Therefore, an increase of OAV never changes the NAV because there has been a corresponding outgoing cash payment, setting the balance to zero. Inflating the OAV at will is therefore impossible, OAV remains an objective truth.

The other element of trust in the NAV is the annual testing of the OAV against the market value. A market valuation is a highly structured process and conducted by external high profile experts under objective conditions (MRICS standard). The whole global institutional real estate market works with such valuations, and so do we. As the results of the market valuation have to be tested against the OAV and eventually OAVI has to be created, the objective marekt conditions are reflected in the NAV.

## Fallacies in commercial real estate valuation
* Residential real estate (apartments) is typically owner-used and therefore the only performance indicator of this market segment is the price of the property. But the performance of commercial real estate fundamentally comes from the rent income generated with it, and not from price increases. Redcurry is taking that principle to its core and ignores fluctuations of the market value (unless it is substantially negative and must be recorded - see above). The increase of the NAV will solely come from the rent income generated, and thus enable a continuous growth of NAV.
* Even though it looks like the OAV is fixed forever, it is not: to maintain the value of a commercial property, one must also invest and therefore the OAV will not remain unchanged. Over a decade or two, a commercial property will require some 10-20% of the OAV in investments, mostly replacement of building technology like heating or cooling systems. Therefore, in the long run the OAV will always grow.
* Tracking of asset values on the basis of OAV cannot be manipulated, as it is solely based on accounting figures, both at acquisition and in case of subsequent increase of the OAV through investments. Buying a property in a calendar year will be reported in the annual report of that year as an asset, with the original acquisition value. As Redcurry's annual report is made public, anyone can cross-check this information leaving no room for manipulation.
