# Real Estate Valuation

## Valuation Principles
The Redcurry valuation methodology is based on the acquisition value of each property. Each property will be recorded at full acquisition cost (including transaction costs) and this value will not be subject to annual depreciation, as typically required under local GAAP rules. 

Once per year, for each property two valuations will be performed: one external Market Price valuation based on standard valuation rules, and one internal valuation based on replacement Cost Approach. The acquisition value of the property will then be compared with the average of the two valuations; if the average of the valuations is equal to or higher than the acquisition value, then nothing happens, and the acquisition value remains unchanged. However, if the average of the valuations is below the acquisition value, then the acquisition value will be corrected downwards by such difference. The correction will be maintained as long as the average of the valuations remains below the acquisitions value, and it will be adapted each year to reflect the most recent difference. Once the average of the valuations exceeds again the acquisition value, the correction will be set to zero.

In case of long-term investments into the building, the acquisition value will increase accordingly. Such investments will include replacement of technical components (e.g., change of elevator), however will not include simple repairs, and not minor investments. The annual comparison of valuations versus acquisition value will of course be performed always against the latest, increased acquisition value. 

When looking at the Value of Real Estate, we are facing a different scenario: while Other Assets and Liabilities change (mostly) through actual cash flow effects (e.g., rent payments reach the bank account of the company), the Value of Real Estate is in mostly a non-cash-flow figure. Only the acquisition or the sale of a property causes cash to flow, but between these two events, the Value of the Real Estate might change many times, without ever having any cash-flow impact. 

## How Real Estate is valued. 
Redcurry does not “say” what something is worth. The organization buys the property at a certain price and that is the effective market price.

There can be an argument that Redcurry could crazily overpay, but it will not because of the independent investment committee of RE professionals, who will not agree to overpay massively.
The Original Acquisition Value (OAV) is not an opinion but a fact.

What is more, Redcurry is not evaluating at will. Rather, its goal is to keep OAV unchanged, as by the definition. This way the NAV is never impacted by the value of the property unless the market price falls below OAV. In this case, an OAV Impairment (OAVI) is applied for as long as the market price is below OAV. This configuration removes any economic incentive for manipulation nor is it technically possible. Neither has Redcurry any influence over OAV or OAVI.

As an example, if Redcurry purchases a property for 20M EUR and records, intentionally, OAV at 19M EUR, then NAV has lost 1M EUR immediately. There is no motive or possibility of manipulation.

In the valuation definition, there is a “spot price” for properties if one wants to sell now, and a “long-term price” if one would wish to solely capitalize on cash flow at going market interest rates. Both are reflecting momentary market conditions. If at the moment one could sell for a higher price but is not planning to do that, then he should not record the higher value of the property to boost the performance at the price of volatility.

## Known fallacies in CRE valuation
* Performance of commercial real estate fundamentally comes from the rent income, not from the price change. Redcurry is taking that principle to its core and ignores fluctuations.

* To maintain the value of a building, you must also invest. OAV cannot remain unchanged forever. During the time, owners will invest ~15-20% of the OAV into a building. After a certain time, the actual OAV will be higher in any case.

* OAV and any subsequent increase of it through investments are facts recorded in the accounting. Buying a property in a calendar year will be reported in the annual report of that year as an asset, with the original acquisition value. As Redcurry’s annual report is made public, anyone can cross-check this information. There is no room for manipulation.
