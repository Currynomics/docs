#    Net Asset Value
The NAV will consist of three parts: Value of real estate assets, cash and receivables - Liabilities. The first part of a NAV "Value of real estate assets" will be reevaluated by external evaluators annually. This part is the locked and fixed part of the NAV. Cash, receivables, and liabilities may change frequently, and this will be reevaluated at shorter intervals and will be transparently automated in the near future.
 
The standard NAV as used in the real estate industry is calculated as follows:
 
NAV = Value of real estate assets + Cash and receivables - Liabilities
 
In the case of Redcurry, the Net Asset Value is always calculated as the total of the current value of the real estate assets, plus cash and receivables, minus liabilities and provisions. To get out the token value from that, this total is then divided by the number of Redcurry Tokens (REDC) minted, also known as the NAV per token. A parallel from the traditional real estate industry is the NAV per share.
 
Cash and equivalents are part of the Treasury. Receivables, as more illiquid assets, are not part of the Treasury. The NAV contains more than just the value of the real estate assets; as in a market of low volatility in real estate prices and a long-term hold focus, the value of the real estate assets will not change much over the year. However, the rental income generated with that real estate asset will increase the cash position and this increases the Net Asset Value.
 
The key factor here is the fact that the Redcurry Holding does not have any external factors forcing it to sell real estate at a certain point in time. There is no investment period to be obeyed and there is no high bank financing in place which might force the owner of a real estate to sell. Therefore, in the case of Redcurry, specific valuation methods need to be used. They are primarily looking at the long-term value of the secured cash flow of the respective property, rather than momentary snapshots of market transaction price levels. These methods are also fully recognised and common under IFRS standards.
