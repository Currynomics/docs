##  Net Asset Value
The fundamental feature of RedCurry is that its value changes over time as RedCurry’s denomination is the Net Asset Value of the real estate portfolio held by RedCurry Holding. Therefore, it is important to understand the fundamentals of the Net Asset Value and how it develops over time.

The standard NAV as used in the real estate industry is calculated the as follows:

> NAV = Value of real estate assets + Cash and receivables - Liabilities

In the case of RedCurry, the Net Asset Value is always calculated as the total of the current value of the real estate assets, plus cash and receivables, minus liabilities and provisions. To get out the token value from that, this total is then divided by the number of RedCurry Tokens minted, also known as the NAV per token. A parallel from the traditional real estate industry is NAV per share.

Cash and equivalents are part of a treasury. Receivables as more illiquid assets are not part of the treasury.

As can be seen from the above definition, the NAV contains more than just the value of the real estate assets. In a market with low volatility of real estate prices and long-term hold focus, the value of the real estate assets will not change much over the course of the year. However, the rental income generated with that real estate asset will increase the cash position and this increases the Net Asset Value. The envisaged increase in the RedCurry NAV is therefore not primarily dependent on the positive development of real estate markets but as well much on the successful operation of the renting business with the real estate portfolio.

However, the change in the value of the real estate in the RedCurry portfolio will have an impact on the NAV. It is therefore essential to understand the valuation method used for determining the value of the real estate portfolio of RedCurry Holding. The key factor here is the fact that RedCurry Holding does not have any external factors forcing it to sell real estate at a certain point in time. There is no investment period to be obeyed and there is no high bank financing in place which might force the owner of a real estate to sell it. Therefore, in the case of RedCurry valuation methods need to be used, they are primarily looking at the long-term value of the secured cash flow of the respective property, rather than momentary snapshots of market transaction price levels. These methods are also fully recognized and common under IFRS standards.

An important feature of the RedCurry system is that the value of RedCurry can never be diluted, irrespective of how much RedCurry tokens are in circulation. The principal rule that any minting or burning of tokens can only occur at the Net Asset Value brings about a situation, where the NAV per Token is always representing the actual value of the assets of the RedCurry Holding. Therefore, the holder of the RedCurry Token cannot experience inflation of the RedCurry Token as it can happen with conventional legal tender, where the National banks can inflate the amount of currency without any change in the underlying foundation of the value of such currency. 

As seen above, NAV will consist of three parts: Value of real estate assets, cash, and receivables - Liabilities. The first part of a NAV “Value of a real estate assets” will be reevaluated by the committee annually. This part is the locked and fixed part of a NAV. Cash and receivables and liabilities might change often and this will be reevaluated once per day and will be transparently automated in the future.
