## RE Strategy
The objective of Redcurry is to provide a cash holder with a value-appreciating alternative (at least to a certain extent) without major volatility. As the value of Redcurry is derived from the Net Asset Value of its real estate portfolio, the investment strategy of Redcurry Holding has to be chosen in such a way that these objectives of Redcurry are assured. Redcurry Holding will invest only in such properties which already have a stable cash flow, and/or can be expected to continue to produce a stable cash flow in the long run. Redcurry Holding will therefore not invest in speculative real estate developments or land-banking projects and will prefer objects with long-term cash flow secured by long, unbreakable lease contracts.
 
Related to the current cash flow is also the suitability of a building for achieving long-term cash flow. This includes factors like the design of the building (is it flexible enough to provide suitable space for different types of tenants?), the current rent income level (is the level of rental income compared to the market such that it is easy to find new tenants at the same, or even higher, price level?), or the operating costs of the building (how much cash flow from rental income is lost for non-recoverable expenses?).
 
To avoid volatility, it will also be important for Redcurry Holding to avoid substantial cluster risk. This means that a building with several strong tenants is generally more favourable than one with only one single tenant and that the size of each property should not be too big in relation to the whole portfolio of properties.
 
Redcurry Holding will aim to have a geographically diverse portfolio, and investment spread in different real estate sectors. However, the investments will be only domiciled in EU countries, with Euro-denominated or Euro-pegged rental agreements, and the properties will be only selected from real estate sectors with a large volume of market participants. Also, the long-term focus means that the choice of properties will not necessarily be comparable with that of some other real estate market participants. Redcurry Holding will not need to invest in so-called "trophy assets”, Redcurry Holding will also be ready to invest in secondary cities, which are experiencing strong economic growth and might not yet be a large submarket for transactions. And Redcurry Holding will not invest in buildings that require, in the near future, a major refurbishment or market repositioning, as this would bring volatility to the Net Asset Value.

In summary, the investment strategy of Redcurry Holding is based on the following key principles:

* Low risk: long-term cash-flow is more important than short-term asset value appreciation, therefore preferably core / core+ properties shall be acquired; multi-tenant buildings preferred
* Long-term: stable cash-flow with low tenancy fluctuation is prime, no speculative turn-around investments; long-term hold strategy
* Independent: no influence of stakeholders on real estate portfolio, hence acquisitions and disposals are only driven by management response to market development


## RE Transactions
As the value of Redcurry is derived solely from the operations of Redcurry Holding as a real estate investor, the Redcurry value indirectly reflects the real estate market situation. Even though the holder of a Redcurry Token is not invested directly in the real estate market, they still enjoy the appreciation of the value of the Redcurry Token - driven by the functioning of the real estate market.
 
As a result of this, Redcurry becomes an interesting tool for professional and/or institutional real estate investors. Typically, a real estate investor will consider in their strategy the right moments when to sell a certain property from a portfolio, and when to buy one from the market. However, as the transactions in the real estate market typically take months, and the selection of the right investment might result in a waiting period of a year or more, each real estate investor has a special problem with holding cash. When selling a property, a real estate investor immediately moves from a high positive return on equity to a – most likely – negative one (through negative interest on their cash position in the bank), which decides to sell a property a much more difficult one. And waiting for a new opportunity might mean a long period with a negative return.
 
An alternative solution for such investors would be to use Redcurry as a transaction currency. Redcurry is beneficial for both sides of the real estate transaction. The seller has the benefit of receiving Redcurry at a purchase price and will avoid immediate negative interest and has the prospect of appreciation of the value of Redcurry. On the buyer's side, holding Redcurry enables investors to take their time in choosing the right property to invest in, as they are not under pressure from negative interest rates. For both parties, Redcurry facilitates a real-time peer-to-peer transaction without the necessity to involve escrow bank accounts or other complicated and time-consuming procedures, adding additional simplification to the real estate investment activities.
 
In cases where Redcurry Holding will not invest directly in the acquisition of a property, but rather acquire a stake in a real estate-owning company or a real estate fund, the valuation of the real estate will happen on the level of the company or the fund. Therefore, Redcurry Holding will only need to evaluate the value of its shareholding versus the acquisition cost, and this again ensures the NAV of Redcurry exactly reflects the value of the investments held by Redcurry Holding.


## RE Valuation Principles
The RedCurry valuation methodology is based on the acquisition value of each property. Each property will be recorded at full acquisition cost (including transaction costs) and this value will not be subject to annual depreciation, as typically required under local GAAP rules. 

Once per year, for each property two valuations will be performed: one external Market Price valuation based on standard valuation rules, and one internal valuation based on replacement Cost Approach. The acquisition value of the property will then be compared with the average of the two valuations; if the average of the valuations is equal to or higher than the acquisition value, then nothing happens, and the acquisition value remains unchanged. However, if the average of the valuations is below the acquisition value, then the acquisition value will be corrected downwards by such difference. The correction will be maintained as long as the average of the valuations remains below the acquisitions value, and it will be adapted each year to reflect the most recent difference. Once the average of the valuations exceeds again the acquisition value, the correction will be set to zero.

In case of long-term investments into the building, the acquisition value will increase accordingly. Such investments will include replacement of technical components (e.g., change of elevator), however will not include simple repairs, and not minor investments. The annual comparison of valuations versus acquisition value will of course be performed always against the latest, increased acquisition value. 

When looking at the Value of Real Estate, we are facing a different scenario: while Other Assets and Liabilities change (mostly) through actual cash flow effects (e.g., rent payments reach the bank account of the company), the Value of Real Estate is in mostly a non-cash-flow figure. Only the acquisition or the sale of a property causes cash to flow, but between these two events, the Value of the Real Estate might change many times, without ever having any cash-flow impact. 

## Managing The Portfolio
The Holding company is a pure investment holding without any real-estate-related operative activities. The costs of the Holding company are covered solely by rental income received via owned SPVs (as dividends) or RE Funds. 

At a later stage, SPVs might be grouped in regional / country holding companies, if that is desirable for operative management or tax reasons. However, the generation of tax advantages will never be a primary goal. The approach to taxation shall be one of fairness and sustainability and balance all interests. 

SPVs will always distribute their profits as far as possible to the Holding company. The SPVs will hold only so much liquidity, as is necessary to fulfill the CAPEX plans, repayment schedules of bank loans (if any), and other needs from day-to-day business. 

<!-- ![image](../../media/img/structure.png) -->

The SPVs will have only a minimal share capital. All other equity shall be provided (if possible) by contributions to capital reserves or similar structures so that equity can easily be returned if there is sufficient liquidity.

All SPVs must in all cases be structured as fully non-recourse i.e., no guarantees of any kind to other group companies or third parties. 

Real estate will be acquired by asset deals or share deals. As the intention is to hold real estate for a long period, latent capital gains taxes may be accepted with a market standard discount. Real estate transactions may also include more than one property, however, preference will be given to the principle of “one SPV – one property”

To avoid lump risks, properties acquired will not be too big concerning the total real estate portfolio. The aim should be that once the portfolio size reaches 500M Euro or more, a single property (but not necessarily a single transaction) shall constitute not more than 10% of the total portfolio value. Balancing of risks over properties, markets and regions shall be ensured.
