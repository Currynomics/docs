## Property Choosing Preferences
* Preference to buildings which have no lump risk (i.e., rather not single-tenant buildings)
* Preference to “classical” commercial real estate with an established and functioning market, rather than “specialty” real estate
* High-quality properties: quality is more important than rental yield, however no “trophy hunting”; focus rather on cash flow than on fast capital appreciation. Long-term usability and functionality of the properties is important, therefore no buildings with demanding and not practical architecture, but rather functional buildings with high technology standards.
* ESG is important, however not an excuse for neglecting other quality criteria of a property
* Investment focus on Europe, especially on well-performing markets, which are strategically interesting in the long run, and not on hyped markets with a clear downturn risk. “We don’t have to be where the party is.”
* Balanced regional risk spread with clear focus on CEE and Tier-2-cities. Cash-Flow and stability of the market have preference over “fame”. 

The management of the Holding will initially be provided by the Management Company (also the initial IP holder and seed investment facilitation body) but shall – as soon as financially meaningful and practical – be built up within the holding company. The functions of the Holding are: 

* Finance: finance management and liquidity planning, tax optimisation, group consolidation
* Information: active information management to the public
* Portfolio: transaction management and supervision of asset management

The Holding will be managed by a CEO with a strong legal background, a CFO with a solid accountancy background and a CIO with hands-on experience in transaction and asset management. The CIO should also be a member of the Investment Committee. 

All group-companies shall have collective signatory rights. On the level of the SPVs, will include the CIO (or a team member) and the Asset Manager. For daily operations, POAs may be given to the Asset Manager, to act alone.

The budgeting process will be bottom-up: Asset Manager and Property Manager prepare a budget for each property; the consolidation and feed-back loop happens on the level of the Holding.

The organisation of the whole group shall be very lean, especially in relation to office management, personal assistants and alike.
