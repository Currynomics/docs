##  Investment Committee
The Investment Committee shall serve as an advisory body to the Holding company. The Investment Committee shall approve investment plans (what type of properties to acquire in which regions and at what price levels), discuss investment strategies (e.g., overweighing or underweighting certain asset categories or markets) and approve heads of terms of intended transactions. 

The Investment Committee shall be composed of a few real estate experts with a deep knowledge of the relevant real estate markets. These persons would typically work for a large real estate advisory firm in a high management position (preferably Head of Capital Markets or Managing Partner). They should not be competitors (i.e., working for large real estate investors) or from industries with only limited knowledge of the market conditions (e.g., from banking).
