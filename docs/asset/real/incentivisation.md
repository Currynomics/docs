## Incentivisation Schemes
As the functioning of RedCurry system is to a certain extent a public function and not a simple profit maximisation scheme, the responsibilities and this also the incentivisation of the managers is different from ordinary real estate investment companies. 

**On the level of the Holding management, the following KPIs are decisive:**  
* Gradually increasing NAV with minimised volatility
* Maintenance of continuous growth of interest in RedCurry
* Safety and security of RedCurry operations in the market
* Accuracy and depth of information provided to the market
* Effectivity of the organisation (minimise expenses as percentage of NAV resp. rent income)
* Development of long-term investment strategy, in relation to properties but also amount of RedCurry in circulation

On the level of the Asset Managers, the incentivisation shall focus even more on the continuity of operations of each property, i.e., low vacancy, low fluctuation of tenants, growing cash flow with minimal volatility, cost efficiency.
