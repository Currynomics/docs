## Incentivisation Schemes
As the functioning of the RedCurry system is to a certain extent a public function and not a simple profit maximization scheme, the responsibilities and this also the incentivization of the managers are different from ordinary real estate investment companies. 

**On the level of the Holding management, the following KPIs are decisive:**  
* Gradually increasing NAV with minimized volatility
* Maintenance of continuous growth of interest in RedCurry
* Safety and security of RedCurry operations in the market
* Accuracy and depth of information provided to the market
* Effectivity of the organization (minimize expenses as a percentage of NAV resp. rent income)
* Development of long-term investment strategy, in relation to properties but also the amount of RedCurry in circulation

At the level of the Asset Managers, the incentivization shall focus even more on the continuity of operations of each property, i.e., low vacancy, low fluctuation of tenants, growing cash flow with minimal volatility, and cost-efficiency.
