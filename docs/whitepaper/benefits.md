# Benefits & Use Cases
Redcurry is smarter than cash and protects you from the effects of inflation. This is a summary of the multiple benefits which come with Redcurry. Let’s have a closer look: 

* Real value: The Redcurry token represents indeed a real value. The Redcurry system ensures that every Euro entering the system ultimately is invested in quality commercial real estate. The value of the Redcurry token is derived from alink between the token and a real physical assets.
* Value growth: Valuable assets like gold have a downside: they cause expenses - cost of storing them. Commercial real estate, in contrast, generates actual returns – high enough to be one of the most attractive asset classes for centuries. In the case of Redcurry, all generated net return is reinvested into more real estate. Even if the value of the individual properties does not increase, the total value of assets does. Redcurry is designed to make the value of the Redcurry token (expressed in the Net Asset Value per token) grow continuously.
* Inflation protection: Storing cash at zero cost is not value preservation because of inflation. The real interest in Euro (bank interest spot rate minus inflation rate) has been in negative territory for most of the time in the last 20 years, and nose-dived only recently to never-before-seen negative levels. Redcurry, in contrast, has multiple “built-in” inflation protection. 
    * Firstly, the Redcurry real estate portfolio generates income, which increases the Net Asset Value per Token (NAPT), and thus the value expressed in Euro raises.
    * Secondly, the rent income is growing in times of inflation as typically rental income from commercial property is annually indexed by the effective inflation rate. 
    * Thirdly, in times of inflation, real estate values tend to increase, as their replacement cost (construction cost, etc.) increases. 
* Low risk: Redcurry derives its value from a professionally managed real estate portfolio, which is mostly not leveraged. Real estate is in general considered to be a low-risk asset class, because of its intrinsic value (“concrete gold”), its long-term ability to generate cash flow, and more so if it is not dependent on bank financing. This makes Redcurry resilient to most short-term market forces. 
* No foreign exchange risk: For Euro cash holders, Redcurry is an alternative with no foreign exchange risk. The Net Asset Value determining the value of Redcurry is denominated in Euro and also the underlying real estate portfolio consists solely of properties located either in a Euro-zone country or an EU country with Euro-pegged rental contracts.
* Simple transferability: Like any token based on DLT technology, the Redcurry token can be easily transferred between wallets with a high finality time.
* Owning to the advancements of DLT technology, the Redcurry system can be run with low costs. Deployed on a PoS layer 2 blockchain means the transaction fees are minuscule. For further details please refer to Redcurry costs.
* Simple taxation treatment: Redcurry is not a security but a means of payment. Essentially, a Redcurry token is an intangible asset and as such very simple to be recorded in the balance sheet of its holder. As Redcurry is not associated with any rights to the assets, the profits from operations are not connected with the holder of Redcurry in any way.
* Regulatory simplicity: The Redcurry token is not a security. Thus, regulatory limitations of securities acts (e.g. MIFID 2) are not applicable, simplifying the handling of Redcurry. However, Redcurry is not unregulated, as it is a payment instrument and as such regulated by banking sector acts.

In its simplest use case, Redcurry is a practical store of value. Instead of leaving Euro money in the bank account and watching it lose value, you can hold Redcurry and benefit from its intrinsic inflation protection. However, there are many more use cases that utilize the vast potential of Redcurry and Currynomics.
