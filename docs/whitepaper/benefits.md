## Benefits & Use Cases

Redcurry is smarter than cash and protects you from the effects of inflation. This is a summary of the multiple benefits which come with Redcurry. Let’s have a closer look: 

* Real value: The Redcurry token represents indeed a real value. The Redcurry system ensures that every Euro entering the system ultimately is invested in quality commercial real estate. The value of the Redcurry token is derived from alink between the token and a real physical assets.
* Value growth: Valuable assets like gold have a downside: they cause expenses - cost of storing them. Commercial real estate, in contrast, generates actual returns – high enough to be one of the most attractive asset classes for centuries. In the case of Redcurry, all generated net return is reinvested into more real estate. Even if the value of the individual properties does not increase, the total value of assets does. Redcurry is designed to make the value of the Redcurry token (expressed in the Net Asset Value per token) grow continuously.
* Inflation protection: Storing cash at zero cost is not value preservation because of inflation. The real interest in Euro (bank interest spot rate minus inflation rate) has been in negative territory for most of the time in the last 20 years, and nose-dived only recently to never-before-seen negative levels. Redcurry, in contrast, has multiple “built-in” inflation protection. 
    * Firstly, the Redcurry real estate portfolio generates income, which increases the Net Asset Value per Token (NAPT), and thus the value expressed in Euro raises.
    * Secondly, the rent income is growing in times of inflation as typically rental income from commercial property is annually indexed by the effective inflation rate. 
    * Thirdly, in times of inflation, real estate values tend to increase, as their replacement cost (construction cost, etc.) increases. 
* Low risk: Redcurry derives its value from a professionally managed real estate portfolio, which is mostly not leveraged. Real estate is in general considered to be a low-risk asset class, because of its intrinsic value (“concrete gold”), its long-term ability to generate cash flow, and more so if it is not dependent on bank financing. This makes Redcurry resilient to most short-term market forces. 
* No foreign exchange risk: For Euro cash holders, Redcurry is an alternative with no foreign exchange risk. The Net Asset Value determining the value of Redcurry is denominated in Euro and also the underlying real estate portfolio consists solely of properties located either in a Euro-zone country or an EU country with Euro-pegged rental contracts.
* Simple transferability: Like any token based on DLT technology, the Redcurry token can be easily transferred between wallets with a high finality time.
* Owning to the advancements of DLT technology, the Redcurry system can be run with low costs. Deployed on a PoS layer 2 blockchain means the transaction fees are minuscule. For further details please refer to Redcurry costs.
* Simple taxation treatment: Redcurry is not a security but a means of payment. Essentially, a Redcurry token is an intangible asset and as such very simple to be recorded in the balance sheet of its holder. As Redcurry is not associated with any rights to the assets, the profits from operations are not connected with the holder of Redcurry in any way.
* Regulatory simplicity: The Redcurry token is not a security. Thus, regulatory limitations of securities acts (e.g. MIFID 2) are not applicable, simplifying the handling of Redcurry. However, Redcurry is not unregulated, as it is a payment instrument and as such regulated by banking sector acts.

In its simplest use case, Redcurry is a practical store of value. Instead of leaving Euro money in the bank account and watching it lose value, you can hold Redcurry and benefit from its intrinsic inflation protection. However, there are many more use cases that utilize the vast potential of Redcurry and Currynomics. 

## Rent Deposit to Deposits, Withholds and Prepayments

### Rental deposits
While the real estate industry deals with assets protected from inflation, it still uses cash in an old-fashioned way. Think of rent deposits - money sitting idle for years, and custody of it somewhat unclear. With Redcurry, rent deposits become valuable, as they increase in value, and external custody is simple and cheap. The same is true for prepayments and withholds during construction processes - instead of losing value, the blocked funds increase in value, and insolvency risks can be mitigated. 

### Savings Solutions
Redcurry is a store of value so it is only logical to implement savings solutions based on the Redcurry token. While bank interests usually are below inflation, Redcurry aims to be a store of value which outperforms inflation. Redcurry is therefore the perfect tool to provide new savings solutions without the necessity to invest in securities or long-term financial instruments. Being a blockchain-based solution, Redcurry will enable even unbanked people to create real savings.

## Payment solutions
Redcurry is the first digital means of payment where its value of it is objective (because it is based on independently valued real estate assets) and not volatile. While until now most purchase transactions with cryptocurrencies ultimately contained an exchange transaction (sellers accept crypto payment but immediately sell against cash), Redcurry allows for real digital payment transactions, where no exchange to fiat is needed. Purchases thus can finally become fully digital, real-time, and cost-efficient.

## For Blockchains and DeFi services.
Redcurry helps to solve a fundamental problem for blockchain ecosystems and DeFi more broadly -a lack of self-sustaining business and revenue models. The majority of DeFi services survive on speculators and financial players putting money into the system more than people living from cryptocurrencies take it out. Redcurry relieves this pain point by bringing real-world revenue into the blockchain in a self-sustaining way - the net rental income of the commercial real estate portfolio is reinvested into the blockchain ecosystem. With no money leaking out, it becomes self-sustaining even without the participation of speculators and financial players. That being said, as they are needed in any financial system, Redcurry enables use cases for them as well.

As the core value of Redcurry is to offer a stable, inflation-resistant asset to the world, we help to bring much-needed price stability to your blockchain, a balance to the volatile cryptocurrency and stablecoin market.
Redcurry brings real-world revenue into the blockchain ecosystem in a self-sustaining manner - the net rental income of the commercial real estate portfolio is reinvested. With no money leaking from this system, it becomes self-sustaining. 
As an infrastructure project, Redcurry enables the development of novel DeFi use cases increasing the real-economy revenue, liquidity, and transactions on your blockchain. This brings new developers, users, investors, business developers, product designers, and the like to your ecosystem.

Following are some concrete examples of Redcurry use cases in DeFi services:

* Buy and hold (Real Estate investment and/or parking your capital into the stable asset); 
* Proptech use cases, Deposits, insurance, inflation protection
* Real asset collateral in DeFi protocols.
