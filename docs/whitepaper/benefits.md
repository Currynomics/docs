Benefits & Use Cases
## Redcurry benefits

Redcurry is smarter than cash and protects you from the effects of inflation. This is a summary of the multiple benefits which come with Redcurry. Let’s have a closer look: 

* Real value: The Redcurry token represents indeed a real value. The Redcurry system ensures that every Euro entering the system ultimately is invested in quality commercial real estate. The value of the Redcurry token is derived from alink between the token and a real physical assets.
* Value growth: Valuable assets like gold have a downside: they cause expenses - cost of storing them. Commercial real estate, in contrast, generates actual returns – high enough to be one of the most attractive asset classes for centuries. In the case of Redcurry, all generated net return is reinvested into more real estate. Even if the value of the individual properties does not increase, the total value of assets does. Redcurry is designed to make the value of the Redcurry token (expressed in the Net Asset Value per token) grow continuously.
* Inflation protection: Storing cash at zero cost is not value preservation because of inflation. The real interest in Euro (bank interest spot rate minus inflation rate) has been in negative territory for most of the time in the last 20 years, and nose-dived only recently to never-before-seen negative levels. Redcurry, in contrast, has multiple “built-in” inflation protection. 
    * Firstly, the Redcurry real estate portfolio generates income, which increases the Net Asset Value per Token (NAPT), and thus the value expressed in Euro raises.
    * Secondly, the rent income is growing in times of inflation as typically rental income from commercial property is annually indexed by the effective inflation rate. 
    * Thirdly, in times of inflation, real estate values tend to increase, as their replacement cost (construction cost, etc.) increases. 
* Low risk: Redcurry derives its value from a professionally managed real estate portfolio, which is mostly not leveraged. Real estate is in general considered to be a low-risk asset class, because of its intrinsic value (“concrete gold”), its long-term ability to generate cash flow, and more so if it is not dependent on bank financing. This makes Redcurry resilient to most short-term market forces. 
* No foreign exchange risk: For Euro cash holders, Redcurry is an alternative with no foreign exchange risk. The Net Asset Value determining the value of Redcurry is denominated in Euro and also the underlying real estate portfolio consists solely of properties located either in a Euro-zone country or an EU country with Euro-pegged rental contracts.
* Simple transferability: Like any token based on DLT technology, the Redcurry token can be easily transferred between wallets with a high finality time.
* Owning to the advancements of DLT technology, the Redcurry system can be run with low costs. Deployed on a PoS layer 2 blockchain means the transaction fees are minuscule. For further details please refer to Redcurry costs.
* Simple taxation treatment: Redcurry is not a security but a means of payment. Essentially, a Redcurry token is an intangible asset and as such very simple to be recorded in the balance sheet of its holder. As Redcurry is not associated with any rights to the assets, the profits from operations are not connected with the holder of Redcurry in any way.
* Regulatory simplicity: The Redcurry token is not a security. Thus, regulatory limitations of securities acts (e.g. MIFID 2) are not applicable, simplifying the handling of Redcurry. However, Redcurry is not unregulated, as it is a payment instrument and as such regulated by banking sector acts.

In its simplest use case, Redcurry is a practical store of value. Instead of leaving Euro money in the bank account and watching it lose value, you can hold Redcurry and benefit from its intrinsic inflation protection. However, there are many more use cases that utilize the vast potential of Redcurry and Currynomics. 

## Real Estate industry

### Rental deposits
While the real estate industry deals with assets protected from inflation, it still uses cash in an old-fashioned way. Think of rent deposits - money sitting idle for years, and custody of it somewhat unclear. With Redcurry, rent deposits become valuable, as they increase in value, and external custody is simple and cheap. The same is true for prepayments and withholds during construction processes - instead of losing value, the blocked funds increase in value, and insolvency risks can be mitigated. 

### Transaction currency
As the value of Redcurry is derived solely from the operations of Redcurry Holding as a real estate investor, the Redcurry value indirectly reflects the real estate market situation. Even though the holder of a Redcurry Token is not invested directly in the real estate market, they still enjoy the appreciation of the value of the Redcurry Token - driven by the functioning of the real estate market.

As a result of this, Redcurry becomes an interesting tool for professional and/or institutional real estate investors. Typically, a real estate investor will consider in their strategy the right moments when to sell a certain property from a portfolio, and when to buy one from the market. However, as the transactions in the real estate market typically take months, and the selection of the right investment might result in a waiting period of a year or more, each real estate investor has a special problem with holding cash. When selling a property, a real estate investor immediately moves from a high positive return on equity to a – most likely – negative one (through negative interest on their cash position in the bank), which decides to sell a property a much more difficult one. 

And waiting for a new opportunity might mean a long period with a negative return.
An alternative solution for such investors would be to use Redcurry as a transaction currency. 

Redcurry is beneficial for both sides of the real estate transaction. The seller has the benefit of receiving Redcurry at a purchase price and will avoid immediate negative interest and has the prospect of appreciation of the value of Redcurry. On the buyer's side, holding Redcurry enables investors to take their time in choosing the right property to invest in, as they are not under pressure from negative interest rates. For both parties, Redcurry facilitates a real-time peer-to-peer transaction without the necessity to involve escrow bank accounts or other complicated and time-consuming procedures, adding additional simplification to the real estate investment activities.

In cases where Redcurry Holding will not invest directly in the acquisition of a property, but rather acquire a stake in a real estate-owning company or a real estate fund, the valuation of the real estate will happen on the level of the company or the fund. Therefore, Redcurry Holding will only need to evaluate the value of its shareholding versus the acquisition cost, and this again ensures the NAV of Redcurry exactly reflects the value of the investments held by Redcurry Holding.

## Liquidity management
While transactions will still be conducted in fiat currency, Redcurry can be used perfectly well for bridging periods of holding liquidity. In real estate transactions, when selling real estate, don’t exit the industry - with Redcurry, you still benefit from the performance of the real estate sector. Or think of Crowdfunding - when exiting an investment, why not stay in Redcurry until you find your next investment target? On larger scales, liquidity management of any cash-intensive business should reasonably include Redcurry for preventing losses from inflation.

## Payment solutions

Redcurry is the first digital means of payment where its value of it is objective (because it is based on independently valued real estate assets) and not volatile. While until now most purchase transactions with cryptocurrencies ultimately contained an exchange transaction (sellers accept crypto payment but immediately sell against cash), Redcurry allows for real digital payment transactions, where no exchange to fiat is needed. Purchases thus can finally become fully digital, real-time, and cost-efficient.

## Crypto uses cases
* Buy and hold (Real Estate investment and/or parking your capital into the stable asset); 
* Proptech use cases, Deposits, insurance, inflation protection
* Real asset collateral in DeFi protocols
