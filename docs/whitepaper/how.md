# How it works
Currynomics, the engine under the bonnet of the Redcurry vehicle, is the concept of creating various “little” digital currencies (hence the name xCurry), whereby all xCurries are designed and issued under the same principles and differ only in one aspect: each of them is based on a different combination of specific asset category and specific fiat currency, to which it is linked to.
 
The NAV of a xCurry is continuously increasing, even if the underlying assets are not changing at all in value, or are even slightly decreasing. The reason is that the treasury of a xCurry is not only receiving cash from issuing a xCurry, but also for the commercial operation of the assets in the treasury: real estate produces rent income, PV power plants sell electricity, etc. This income stays in the treasury and is reinvested into further assets, thus automatically increasing the NAV and ensuring the xCurries are appreciating in value.
 
The NAV (Net Asset Value) reference requires that a xCurry is non-inflationary in relation to its NAV: each xCurry may be issued only at the current NAV, and the proceeds of such issue must go in full to the treasury, for the acquisition of assets of the respective asset category, by which the xCurry is defined. By this, any new supply of xCurries does not have any impact on the value of the xCurry itself.
 
The volume growth of a xCurry is limited, both concerning the speed of growth and the total volume, as the volume growth depends on the availability of assets to be purchased for the treasury. Therefore, a xCurry is indeed a "little" currency in volume, in comparison to fiat currencies. While the money supply of EUR or USD amounts to trillions, the supply of a xCurry can only be a small fraction of this, staying in the billions at most.
 
The combination of the NAV principle with the described cash-flow generating asset categories leads to a unique behaviour in the development of the value of a xCurry as the supply of xCurries has zero impact on the value of the xCurry.
 
Any new xCurry supply leads immediately to an increase in assets in the treasury, and thus the NAV, which expresses the value of a xCurry, stays unchanged. XCurries are therefore non-inflationary. Unlike a commodity-pegged currency, the NAV of a xCurry is not volatile: the market price of assets such as agricultural land or PV power plants barely fluctuates, and long-term exhibits linear price developments.
