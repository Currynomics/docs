# Redcurry Compared To Other Financial Instruments
Redcurry is not linked to any traded securities or other financial instruments, or any other volatile asset class. And it is not linked to assets that do not generate a positive cash flow or can generate a negative cash flow (storage cost), like precious metals, commodities, art, etc.
 
Redcurry is non-inflationary, stable, and appreciative compared to its reference currency (Euro), and is resistant to fiat currency inflation. The NAV of Redcurry is increasing, even if the underlying assets remain unchanged in value. The reason is that the Redcurry treasury is not only receiving cash from minting but also from the commercial operation of the real estate assets, i.e. rental income. This income is reinvested into additional real estate, automatically increasing the NAV. Real estate tends to increase in value during times of inflation, and also rental income increases, as typically rental agreements are inflation-indexed. This provides a double shield against inflation.

### Hidden Volatilites
Asset Managers often recommend two asset classes to be used for a store of value or parking of liquidity - gold and bonds. While both asset categories are very well established, they have intrinsic disadvantages, which are easily overlooked - cost and volatility.

Let’s start with gold. In the past, many currencies were linked to gold and remained stable in value for long period, as neither the demand nor the supply of gold changed substantially. Today, gold is being traded as an asset in large volumes and therefore the gold price shows sometimes very substantial volatility to a fiat currency. Holding gold over a period of let’s say one year can lead to a significant loss of value, even though over a multi-year horizon the value of gold usually is stable. On top of that, gold, like other precious metals, has hidden costs. First and foremost, it requires safe storage which comes at a not-small cost. Beyond that, it has a buy-sell spread that can reach several percentage points and thus makes transactions expensive. 

In the case of bonds, the volatility issue is also relevant: a long-term investment in bonds means that a change in the interest rate environment (like it happened in 2022) causes the price of bonds to fall substantially. A bond for example is appropriately priced at 130, if it bears a 4% coupon for 10 years, and if the market interest rate is 2% and the risk margin for the bond is 1%. At 130, you have a 4% coupon but a 3% return on the investment, as the bond is repaid at 100, not 130. If in such an environment the market interest rate raises from 2% to 3%, the price for the bond will immediately fall from 130 to 100. Therefore, also a bond can lead to a substantial loss of value, if not held until maturity, even if it is a top-rated government bond.

## Redcurry vs. Stablecoin
Considering the inherent stability of Redcurry and the fact that it is blockchain-based, it makes sense to look at the similarities and differences between Redcurry and a stablecoin. Redcurry of course is not meant to be stable versus a reference currency as it is meant to appreciate to offset the impact of inflation. The NAV as the reference for the Redcurry value, based on real physical, cash-flow generating assets, makes Redcurry therefore superior to common stablecoins. However, Redcurry is non-redeemable, which suggests that holding a large volume of Redcurry tokens in relation to the total amount of tokens in circulation bears the risk that one can not liquidate the token holding quickly, as long as large liquidity providers have not evolved. But Redcurry is meant to be held not for intraday trading, but for holding periods of several months to several years.

For a mid-to long-term holding period, Redcurry offers various advantages over stablecoins:

### Stablecoins Compared
Most successful stablecoins today are centralized - USDC, USDT, and BUSD.

Stablecoins issued on-chain have many convenient properties and can be described as follows: 
* public - open for use by anyone
* censorship resistant (the issuer can blacklist and freeze addresses, but such activity is transparent with considerable costs associated with freezing each address).
* interact well with on-chain infrastructure (accounts, DEXes, etc).

Ultimately though, such FIAT-backed stablecoin ongoing stability depends on the macroeconomic and political stability of the US, the continued supportive regulatory environment, and the credibility of the issuing organization.

Thus it is not clear how long this will last and there is a clear need to keep working on alternatives.

The stablecoin design space can be split into three: 
1) centralized stablecoins (e.g. USDT)
2) Currynomics governed real-world-asset (RWA) backed tokens (e.g. Redcurry)
3) governance-minimized crypto-backed stablecoins

## Redcurry vs Bitcoin
Bitcoin has failed to serve as a currency, there are too few commercial transactions. It has served as a speculative investment and as a tool for anonymity. This has caused BTC as a price for goods to be extremely volatile preventing it from being universally accepted. While inflation is a sometimes more, sometimes less gentle slope downwards, volatility is a roller-coaster ride with an unclear ending – both are undesirable.

Skepticism about Bitcoin as a currency is mainly driven by the fact that its movement has little to do with anything while it has been shown to not be a good inflation hedge. Instead, an inflation-hedged stablecoin is considered a more preferred medium of currency.

<hr>
RWA-backed stablecoins can be the medium. Such money can combine enough robustness, censorship resistance, scale, and economic practicality to satisfy a large number of real-world users. 

Making this work requires both real-world legal work to develop robust issuers and resilience-oriented governance engineering.
