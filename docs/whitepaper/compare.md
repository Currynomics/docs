# Redcurry vs Other Financial Instruments
Redcurry is not linked to any traded securities or other financial instruments, or any other volatile asset class. And it is not linked to assets that do not generate a positive cash flow or can generate a negative cash flow (storage cost), like precious metals, commodities, art, etc.
 
Redcurry is non-inflationary, stable, and appreciative compared to its reference currency (Euro), and is resistant to fiat currency inflation. As a fundamental principle, a Curry is only linked to such asset categories which are generating a continuous positive cash flow, have little volatility in value, and are based on physical long-term fixed assets. Such assets can be commercial real estate (as in Redcurry), agricultural land and forests, PV power plants and wind parks, electricity or gas distribution networks, toll highways or railroad tracks, etc.
 
The NAV of Redcurry is increasing, even if the underlying assets remain unchanged in value. The reason is that the Redcurry treasury is not only receiving cash from minting but also from the commercial operation of the real estate assets, i.e. rental income. This income is reinvested into additional real estate, automatically increasing the NAV. Real estate tends to increase in value during times of inflation, and also rental income increases, as typically rental agreements are inflation-indexed. This provides a double shield against inflation.
 
Therefore, holding Redcurry in itself has merits - it’s smarter than cash, and protects you from the effects of inflation. And there is a bigger picture: Redcurry is also an ecosystem for the development of many highly innovative use cases. [Read more about Redcurry benefits and use cases](/whitepaper/benefits.md)

## Gold
The aftermath of World War I, the Great Depression, and the work of economists like John Maynard Keynes, showed the inefficiencies of the gold standard as a monetary principle for national banks in managing an economic crisis. Its successor, the Bretton Woods system of monetary management, which ultimately was also gold-backed via the US Dollar, also proved to be unsuitable for the global economy, and thus was abolished in the 1970s.

In the past, many currencies were linked to gold and therefore stable in value. Nowadays, with gold being traded as an asset in large volumes, the volatility of the gold price in relation to a fiat currency is not making gold a suitable short-term store of value.

Precious metals also have hidden costs. Gold has an average of 1.23% to 10.54% buy-sell spread. In addition, the price volatility, it is not making it a suitable short-term store of value.

Linking “new” money, an asset category should be chosen that is not volatile. Low volatility is often associated with bonds, but there are other suitable asset categories.

## Bonds
The prime argument to comparing bonds to Redcurry is that Redcurry is not a security. You can freely transfer Redcurry, but you cannot freely transfer bonds, as they are securities.

Connected with that, bonds also have an interest coupon, which has its own tax implications depending on the jurisdictions involved.

The volatility issue with bonds is also relevant: a long term investment in bonds means that a change of interest rate environment (like it happened now) causes price of bonds to fall substantially. A bond for example is properly priced at 130, if it bears a 4% coupon for 10 years, and if the market interest rate is 2% and the risk margin for the bond is 1%. At 130, you have a 4% coupon but a 3% return on investment, as the bond is repaid at 100, and not 130. If in such environment the market interest rate raises from 2% to 3%, the price for the bond will immediately fall from 130 to 100. 

The same would actually happen with real estate as well, however, while in case of a bond neither the repayment nominal of 100 nor the interest rate will change, in case of a real estate you quite likely will see higher rent income (higher interest rate usually mean high inflation) and also higher demand for real estate would ultimately set off the price impact of higher interest rates.

## Fiat and stablecoins
The challenges of the modern global economy and the temptation or need for politics to sacrifice the value preservation of money and to utilize monetary policy for various other goals, calls for new solutions. While stablecoins are pegged to fiat and they do enable fast transactions and utilize other opportunities, they do not solve the main problem: inflation and the resulting loss of value of fiat money.

Today’s money is fiat money. It is not backed by any commodity nor does it have any intrinsic value. It has value because it is typically declared by the governments to be legal tender and the people who use it agree on its value. But as fiat money is not backed by anything, the supply of such money is in principle unlimited. Oversupply of money typically leads to inflation, or in extreme cases to hyperinflation. And while the task of national banks issuing fiat money is typically also to fight inflation, we see that the political interests might compel a national bank to abandon its inflation containment goal to a lesser or larger extent.

Inflation is destroying one of the main functions of money: a store of value. This is the reason why some, like the Austrian School of Economics, represented by Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics laureate Friedrich August von Hayek, and others, challenge the concept of inflation as a monetary policy instrument. In 1943, von Hayek suggested a commodity reserve currency based on a basket of various commodities, as an alternative to the gold standard. And several decades later, in 1976, he published an even more interesting paper called “Denationalization of Money: An Analysis of the Theory and Practice of Concurrent Currencies”.

The question, whether on the level of national economies a certain loss of value caused by tolerated inflation is acceptable is an ongoing debate. However, on the level of the individual, it is obvious that store of value is of prime importance. 

The aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis and increasing government deficits have led to an expansionary monetary policy. In such an environment, the store of value has gained even greater importance.

## Cryptocurrencies
Friedrich von Hayek’s vision of denationalized money and concurrent currencies has become de-facto reality today. The appearance of digital currencies, with Bitcoin as the frontrunner, has fundamentally reshaped the global money market. And while von Hayek still envisaged private currencies as classical bank money, the reality of the 21st century produced a currency out of a few lines of computer code, with no bank or any other intermediate party involved at all. Digital currencies in their short time of existence have proven to be easily transferable at low cost (mostly) and opened many doors to various new forms for financial activities.

However, even though Bitcoin is the prototype digital currency, it has failed to serve as a currency in its original meaning: only very little commercial transactions are paid for in Bitcoin. It has mostly served as a speculative investment and as a tool for anonymous transfer of funds. The speculative investment character has led to a situation where prices for goods expressed in Bitcoin are extremely volatile. A car costing 1.0 Bitcoins today might cost 1.1 Bitcoins tomorrow. It’s obvious that volatility prevents a digital currency from being universally accepted for exchange of goods, if a fiat currency exists in parallel with the function of a legal tender, because the reference pricing will always occur in the fiat currency. 

While inflation is a sometimes more, sometimes less gentle slope downwards, volatility is a roller-coaster ride with an unclear ending – both are undesirable.
