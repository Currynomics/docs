# Redcurry Stakeholders
Understanding our market, its nuances, and the stakeholders it comprises is paramount to Redcurry’s success. This section elaborates on the key stakeholders who interact with our ecosystem and how our solution addresses their unique challenges:

* Investors and Asset Holders: Those looking for safe avenues to park their capital, especially in the face of fiat currency depreciation. Redcurry offers them a tangible, real-world asset that's less volatile than traditional cryptocurrencies and more growth-oriented than just keeping money stagnant in a bank.

* Tenants and Real Estate Professionals: Parties involved in rent deposits, prepayments, or withholdings will find Redcurry advantageous. The traditionally "idle" rent deposits now have the potential to appreciate, making the whole process more value-driven.

* The Unbanked Population: One of our core use cases revolves around providing the unbanked population with a tangible savings solution. Redcurry gives them a chance to be part of the financial system without the traditional barriers they face.

* Merchants and Payment Solution Providers: Businesses and entities that require stable and efficient payment methods will benefit from Redcurry’s objective intrinsic value. Our solution supports digital transactions that don't require immediate conversion to fiat, simplifying and speeding up the process.

* Blockchain Ecosystem and DeFi Service Providers: With Redcurry, DeFi projects can tap into a self-sustaining revenue model, addressing the industry's critical challenge of over-reliance on speculators. Redcurry brings in real-world revenue, creating a more stable foundation for blockchain projects and services.

* Proptech & DeFi Innovators: As Redcurry becomes integrated into the broader ecosystem, it can serve as a reliable collateral or underlying asset in various Proptech and DeFi protocols, fostering innovation and new use cases.

## AMM Traders and Liquidity Providers
Let's delve into how Automated Market Makers (AMM) Traders and Liquidity Providers interact with Redcurry.
Understanding the unique needs of AMM traders and liquidity providers and integrating Redcurry into their ecosystem can foster a symbiotic relationship, enhancing the efficiency and growth potential for all involved parties.

* Capital Efficiency and Diversification: AMM traders often seek avenues to diversify their portfolios and hedge against risks associated with other volatile assets. Redcurry offers them an opportunity to expand their portfolio with an asset tied to real estate, granting both stability and growth.

* Enhanced Liquidity: By integrating Redcurry into AMM protocols, liquidity providers can benefit from a more diverse liquidity pool. Redcurry, with its tangible backing, is an attractive asset for providers looking to offer more than just traditional crypto assets in their pools.

* Stable Yield Generation: The intrinsic value and growth mechanisms of Redcurry provide a promising avenue for liquidity providers. As Redcurry is reinvested with net returns from commercial real estate, it can serve as a consistent and stable yield-generating asset in AMM pools.

* Risk Mitigation: AMM traders and liquidity providers are often exposed to impermanent loss, especially in volatile markets. Redcurry’s stability and growth potential can act as a cushion, mitigating some of the risks associated with providing liquidity or trading in more volatile pairs.

By recognizing and addressing the needs of these stakeholders, Redcurry ensures that it isn't just another digital currency in the market. Instead, it becomes a transformative tool designed with the challenges and aspirations of its users at its core.
