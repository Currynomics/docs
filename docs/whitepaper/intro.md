# Introduction
Holding liquidity has a price. However, switching to other asset classes like securities for obtaining reasonable returns either exposes the investor to high volatility or requires a long-hold investment approach, thwarting the original intention of holding liquidity. There are three main perspectives to this problem:

Conventional money inflation rate is higher than ever therefore there is a need to find more stable underlying currency.
Real Estate sector has very low liquidity. Investors have to wait long and they cannot liquidate their investment very easily.
Cryptocurrency sector is very volatile and there isnâ€™t a good option to park your capital into a stable asset.

Redcurry solves the above problems by bringing a transparent and secure collateralized stability into the volatile cryptocurrency market whlie commoditizing the the illiquid real estate market. By being backed by a stable quality real estate, Redcurry will achieve the following objectives:

Continuous increase in value (denominated in EUR)
Very low volatility
High transparency and security
Token based approach provides liquidity on market.

This makes Redcurry a great storehold of wealth, addressing the challenges of the economies and markets - near-zero interest rates, inflationary dynamics, purchasing power or volatility of other asset classes. The solution consists of two sides:

Managing the sustainable and high quality commercial real estate fund which is designed for stability in mind instead of focusing on high rental yields. While keeping in mind that healthy yield is a sign of quality. Yield is reinvested back into the portoflio incresing the face-value of REDC. 
Managing the treasury and market making together with our financial distribution partners in a way that the demand and supply, and therefore market price, closely transports the portolios NAV.
