# Introduction
<!-- Today's money is fiat money. It is not backed by any commodity, nor does it have any intrinsic value. It has value because it is typically declared by governments to be legal tender and the people who use it agree on its value. But as fiat money is not backed by anything, the supply of such money is in principle unlimited. Oversupply of money typically leads to inflation, or in extreme cases to hyperinflation. And while the task of national banks issuing fiat money is typically also to fight inflation, we see that political interests might compel a national bank to abandon its inflation containment goal to a lesser or larger extent.
 
Inflation is destroying one of the main functions of money: a store of value. This is the reason why some, like the Austrian School of Economics, represented by Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics laureate Friedrich August von Hayek, and others, challenge the concept of inflation as a monetary policy instrument. In 1943, von Hayek suggested a commodity reserve currency based on a basket of various commodities, as an alternative to the gold standard.
 
The question, of whether on the level of national economies a certain loss of value caused by tolerated inflation is acceptable, might be answered in different ways, and the academic debate will continue. However, on the level of the individual, it is obvious that the store of value is of prime importance. The aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, and increasing government deficits, have led to an expansionary monetary policy with extremely low-interest rates and a substantial risk of high inflation. In such an environment, the store of value has gained even greater importance.
 
The challenges of the modern global economy and the temptation (or need) for politics to sacrifice the value preservation of money and to utilize monetary policy for various other goals, call for new solutions; the last two decades have shown tremendous new possibilities with the advance of digital technology, specifically with the adoption of blockchain applications.
 
However, even though Bitcoin is the prototype digital currency, it hasnâ€™t served us as a currency in its original meaning: only very few commercial transactions are paid for in Bitcoin. It has mostly served as a speculative investment, and as a tool for the anonymous transfer of funds. The speculative investment character has led to a situation where prices for goods expressed in Bitcoin are extremely volatile. So we would need something more stable! -->
