# Introduction
The monetary theory has for decades discussed ideas of new forms of money. While Bitcoin and others have built their concept on defined scarcity or algorithms, we have taken a fresh look at money in general and realized that it is time for a truly new type of money. Enter the universe of Currynomics in this(1) read to understand our approach and discover Curries as such a new type of money.

Redcurry is our first Curry: the first digital currency fully linked to the Net Asset Value (NAV) of a commercial real estate portfolio. Why have we chosen real estate? Because it is a well-established asset category with a huge market volume, and at the same time provides for long-term price stability and good inflation protection. Read more on the real estate element of Redcurry in the Background Information section here(6).

Redcurry is non-inflationary, not volatile, appreciates compared to its reference currency (Euro), and is resistant to fiat currency inflation. Here is why:

* Redcurry is always minted at the current NAV per Redcurry token. The minting proceeds go in full to the treasury and are used for the acquisition of real estate. Thus, any new supply of Redcurry has zero impact on the value of Redcurry: it leads immediately to an increase in assets in the treasury (first cash, then real estate) and thus the NAV per Redcurry stays unchanged. Redcurry is therefore non-inflationary and non-diluting.
* The NAV of Redcurry is not volatile: it is based on the value of its commercial real estate portfolio. The value of these assets does not stay stable over multi-year periods (it often tends to increase), but it typically does not change much, if at all, over a period of a couple of months.
* The NAV of Redcurry is increasing even if the underlying assets are not changing in value. The reason is that the Redcurry treasury is not only receiving cash from minting but also for the commercial operation of the real estate assets, i.e., rental income. This income is reinvested into further real estate, automatically increasing the NAV. Redcurry is thus systematically appreciating.
* Real Estate tends to increase in value during times of inflation, and also rent income increases, as typically rent agreements are inflation-indexed. This provides double protection against inflation. Redcurry is resistant to Euro inflation.

Redcurry fully follows the Currynomics principles and is ultimately governed by the non-profit Currynomics Foundation, acting solely for the benefit of the Redcurry and Currynomics community. Read more about the functioning and the structure of Redcurry in the next chapter here(2).

Holding Redcurry in itself has its merits - it’s smarter than cash and protects you from the effects of inflation. But there is a bigger picture: Redcurry is also an ecosystem for the development of numerous highly innovative use cases. Read our use-case section here(3) for more on the disruptive changes Redcurry can bring to various fields of business activity.


Redcurry is intended to be a general means of payment and store-of-value for everyone, so we made the project fully transparent, highly decentralized, and public domain. All relevant information relating to the assets will be permanently available online for everyone, not just the Redcurry token holders. And we will work with the best industry partners to have real estate values and balance sheets fully audited. Have a look at our information policy section here(7).

Redcurry is open-source, fully transparent, audited, permissionless, and on-chain. It is currently being implemented on Ethereum and other chains. Redcurry is governed by the Currinomics Foundation, but will gradually evolve toward a DAO. Read more about the Redcurry technology and the Currynomics governance token here(8).

With Redcurry we are opening the first chapter of a truly inspiring book. Redcurry will not remain solitary, but will soon be accompanied by other Curries, based on different assets, with new use cases and stories attached to them. Stay tuned for more to come.

<!-- Today's money is fiat money. It is not backed by any commodity, nor does it have any intrinsic value. It has value because it is typically declared by governments to be legal tender and the people who use it agree on its value. But as fiat money is not backed by anything, the supply of such money is in principle unlimited. Oversupply of money typically leads to inflation, or in extreme cases to hyperinflation. And while the task of national banks issuing fiat money is typically also to fight inflation, we see that political interests might compel a national bank to abandon its inflation containment goal to a lesser or larger extent.
 
Inflation is destroying one of the main functions of money: a store of value. This is the reason why some, like the Austrian School of Economics, represented by Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics laureate Friedrich August von Hayek, and others, challenge the concept of inflation as a monetary policy instrument. In 1943, von Hayek suggested a commodity reserve currency based on a basket of various commodities, as an alternative to the gold standard.
 
The question, of whether on the level of national economies a certain loss of value caused by tolerated inflation is acceptable, might be answered in different ways, and the academic debate will continue. However, on the level of the individual, it is obvious that the store of value is of prime importance. The aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, and increasing government deficits, have led to an expansionary monetary policy with extremely low-interest rates and a substantial risk of high inflation. In such an environment, the store of value has gained even greater importance.
 
The challenges of the modern global economy and the temptation (or need) for politics to sacrifice the value preservation of money and to utilize monetary policy for various other goals, call for new solutions; the last two decades have shown tremendous new possibilities with the advance of digital technology, specifically with the adoption of blockchain applications.
 
However, even though Bitcoin is the prototype digital currency, it hasn’t served us as a currency in its original meaning: only very few commercial transactions are paid for in Bitcoin. It has mostly served as a speculative investment, and as a tool for the anonymous transfer of funds. The speculative investment character has led to a situation where prices for goods expressed in Bitcoin are extremely volatile. So we would need something more stable! -->
