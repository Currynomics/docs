# Security & Trust
For an investor, an important question is security - trusting that the system maintains its value and operates to the benefit of the token holders.
To ensure the security of the system, we developed RedCurry around a legal framework which assures:
* independent decision-makers inhibited from developing motivations to misuse the system;
* execution is transparent as all decisions are in the public domain;
* stakeholders are governed strictly by laws, not morals.

We achieved the above through a multi-national [legal structure](asset/legal/overview.md). [RedCurry Holding](asset/legal/holding.md) responsible for issuing the tokens against funds is liable to only invest the money into real estate following a predefined property selection framework. The Holding Company shall manage the portfolio and establish subsidiaries (e.g. SPV-s) to manage the real estate portfolio. The Holding Company will receive revenue from regular portfolio management via rent payments and real estate sales that shall be used to purchase additional real estate objects. Thus, the Holding Company reinvests all its income and continuously increases it portfolio value, increasing the face value of the RedCurry Token in the process.

RedCurry Holding is subjugated to the non-profit [Currinomics Foundation](asset/legal/foundation.md) established in Austria and governed by its immutable Foundation Deed under the authority of the Austrian court.
