# Abstract
Redcurry is a decentralized blockchain ecosystem that ties its stablecoin's<sup>[1]</sup> value to a commercial real estate portfolio's Net Asset Value (NAV). It addresses the common problem among stablecoins of trust in the token's underlying assets by self-sustainably maintaining the currency peg. Redcurry, issued by [Redcurry Holding](/asset/legal/overview?id=redcurry-holding) and owned by the [Currinomics Foundation](/asset/legal/overview?id=currynomics-foundation), acts as a bridge between traditional and crypto economies, continuously increasing in value through reinvested proceeds from real estate revenues.

Redcurry differs from other stablecoins like USDT as its supply is not fixed, and it doesn't grant holders rights to the underlying property. Instead, it "truly commoditizes" real estate by reinvesting financial gains back into the system. Redcurry Holding uses funds from token purchases to buy real estate, generating recurring revenue that is redirected into purchasing more properties. No money exits the holding, ensuring the portfolio value solely backs the Redcurry token.

The Redcurry ecosystem comprises core bodies, including Redcurry Holding, Currynomics Labs OÜ, and Currynomics. Currynomics Labs OÜ provides development, marketing, and management services, while Currynomics governs the token economy using the governance tokens in decision-making operations.

*Redcurry portfolio generation and cash movement cycle*


*1 - Stablecoin is a store of value token with the main function of facilitating payments but with an important property of reducing token price volatility (FINMA, 2019). By binding its price to chosen underlying assets, typically fiat currencies, stablecoins maintain a stable value with regard to the latter (Khamisa, 2021). For example, a single USD Coin can be purchased at a price equal to the underlying asset, one US dollar. Additional examples of such assets can be other cryptocurrencies, securities, or commodities.*
